<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>In this book I have tried to embody the chief
results derived from a study of all the materials
known to me, in print and in manuscript, relating
to Patrick Henry,&mdash;many of these materials
being now used for the first time in any formal
presentation of his life.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the great popular interest attaching
to the name of Patrick Henry, he has
hitherto been the subject of but one memoir
founded on original investigation, and that, of
course, is the Life by William Wirt. When it is
considered, however, that Wirt&#8217;s book was finished
as long ago as the year 1817,&mdash;before the time
had fairly come for the publication of the correspondence,
diaries, personal memoranda, and official
records of every sort, illustrating the great
period covered by Patrick Henry&#8217;s career,&mdash;it
will be easy to infer something as to the quantity
and the value of those printed materials bearing
upon the subject, which are now to be had by us,
but which were not within the reach of Wirt.
Accordingly, in his lack of much of the detailed
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
testimony that then lay buried in inaccessible documents,
Wirt had to trust largely to the somewhat
imaginative traditions concerning Patrick Henry
which he found floating in the air of Virginia;
and especially to the supposed recollections of old
people,&mdash;recollections which, in this case, were
nearly always vague, not always disinterested,
often inaccurate, and generally made up of emotional
impressions rather than of facts. Any one
who will take the trouble to ascertain the enormous
disadvantages under which Wirt wrote, and
which, as we now know, gave him great discouragement,
will be inclined to applaud him for making
so good a book, rather than to blame him for
not making a better one.</p>

<p>It is proper for me to state that, besides the
copious printed materials now within reach, I have
been able to make use of a large number of manuscripts
relating to my subject. Of these may be
specified a document, belonging to Cornell University,
written by a great-grandson of Patrick
Henry, the late Rev. Edward Fontaine, and giving,
among other things, several new anecdotes
of the great orator, as told to the writer by his
own father, Colonel Patrick Henry Fontaine, who
was much with Patrick Henry during the later
years of his life. I may add that, through the
kindness of the Hon. William Wirt Henry of
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
Richmond, I have had access to the manuscripts
which were collected by Wirt for the purposes of
his book, but were only in part used by him.
With unstinted generosity, Mr. Henry likewise
placed in my hands all the papers relating to his
illustrious grandfather, which, during the past
thirty years or more, he has succeeded in bringing
together, either from different branches of the
family, or from other sources. A portion of the
manuscripts thus accumulated by him consists of
copies of the letters, now preserved in the Department
of State, written by Patrick Henry, chiefly
while governor of Virginia, to General Washington,
to the president of Congress, to Virginia&#8217;s
delegation in Congress, and to the Board of War.</p>

<p>In the very front of this book, therefore, I record
my grateful acknowledgments to Mr. William
Wirt Henry; acknowledgments not alone
for the sort of generosity of which I have just
spoken, but for another sort, also, which is still
more rare, and which I cannot so easily describe,&mdash;his
perfect delicacy, while promoting my more
difficult researches by his invaluable help, in never
once encumbering that help with the least effort to
hamper my judgment, or to sway it from the natural
conclusions to which my studies might lead.</p>

<p>Finally, it gives me pleasure to mention that,
in the preparation of this book, I have received
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
courteous assistance from Mr. Theodore F. Dwight
and Mr. S. M. Hamilton of the library of the
Department of State; from the Rev. Professor
W. M. Hughes, of Hobart College; and from the
Rev. Stephen H. Synnott, rector of St. John&#8217;s,
Ithaca.</p>

<h2>PREFACE <br />
<span class="hsub">TO REVISED EDITION</span></h2>


<p>I have gladly used the opportunity afforded by
a new edition of this book to give the text a minute
revision from beginning to end, and to make
numerous changes both in its substance and in its
form.</p>

<p>During the eleven years that have passed since
it first came from the press, considerable additions
have been made to our documentary materials for
the period covered by it, the most important for
our purpose being the publication, for the first
time, of the correspondence and the speeches of
Patrick Henry and of George Mason, the former
with a life, in three volumes, by William Wirt
Henry, the latter also with a life, in two volumes,
by Kate Mason Rowland. Besides procuring for
my own pages whatever benefit I could draw from
these texts, I have tried, while turning over very
frequently the writings of Patrick Henry&#8217;s contemporaries,
to be always on the watch for the
means of correcting any mistakes I may have
made concerning him, whether as to fact or as to
opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>In this work of rectification I have likewise
been aided by suggestions from many persons, of
whom I would particularly mention the Right
Rev. Joseph Blount Cheshire, Jr., D. D., Bishop
of North Carolina, and Mr. William Wirt Henry.</p>

<h1>PATRICK HENRY</h1>

<h2>CHAPTER I <br />
<span class="hsub">EARLY YEARS</span></h2>


<p>On the evening of October 7, 1732, that merry
Old Virginian, Colonel William Byrd of Westover,
having just finished a journey through King
William County for the inspection of his estates,
was conducted, for his night&#8217;s lodging, to the
house of a blooming widow, Mistress Sarah Syme,
in the county of Hanover. This lady, at first
supposing her guest to be some new suitor for
her lately disengaged affections, &#8220;put on a Gravity
that becomes a Weed;&#8221; but so soon as she learned
her mistake and the name of her distinguished
visitor, she &#8220;brighten&#8217;d up into an unusual cheerfulness
and Serenity. She was a portly, handsome
Dame, of the Family of Esau, and seem&#8217;d not to
pine too much for the Death of her Husband, who
was of the Family of the Saracens.&hellip; This
widow is a person of a lively &amp; cheerful Conversation,
with much less Reserve than most of her
Countrywomen. It becomes her very well, and
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
sets off her other agreeable Qualities to Advantage.
We tost off a Bottle of honest Port, which
we relisht with a broil&#8217;d Chicken. At Nine I retir&#8217;d
to my Devotions, And then Slept so Sound
that Fancy itself was Stupify&#8217;d, else I shou&#8217;d have
dreamt of my most obliging Landlady.&#8221; The next
day being Sunday, &#8220;the courteous Widow invited
me to rest myself there that good day, and go to
Church with Her, but I excus&#8217;d myself by telling
her she wou&#8217;d certainly spoil my Devotion. Then
she civilly entreated me to make her House my
Home whenever I visited my Plantations, which
made me bow low, and thank her very
kindly.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor1" id="FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote-1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
</p>

<p>Not very long after that notable visit, the
sprightly widow gave her hand in marriage to a
young Scotchman of good family, John Henry, of
Aberdeen, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; and probably a kinsman of
her former husband; and continuing to reside on
her estate of Studley, in the county of Hanover,
she became, on May 29, 1736, the mother of Patrick
Henry.</p>

<p>Through the lineage of both his parents, this
child had some claim to an inheritance of brains.
The father, a man of firm and sound intellect, had
been liberally educated in Scotland; among the
country gentlemen of his neighborhood in Virginia,
he was held in high esteem for superior intelligence
and character, as is shown by the positions he long
held of county surveyor, colonel of his regiment,
and presiding judge of the county court; while he
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
could number among his near kinsmen at home
several persons of eminence as divines, orators, or
men of letters,&mdash;such as his uncle, William Robertson,
minister of Borthwick in Mid Lothian
and afterward of the Old Greyfriars&#8217; Church
in Edinburgh; his cousin, David Henry, the successor
of Edward Cave in the management of
the &#8220;Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine;&#8221; and especially his
cousin, William Robertson, principal of the University
of Edinburgh, and author of the &#8220;History of
the Reign of the Emperor Charles V.&#8221; Moreover,
among the later paternal relatives of Patrick Henry
may be mentioned one person of oratorical and
forensic genius very brilliant and in quality not
unlike his own. Patrick Henry&#8217;s father was second
cousin to that beautiful Eleanor Syme of
Edinburgh, who, in 1777, became the wife of
Henry Brougham of Brougham Hall, Westmoreland.
Their eldest son was Lord Brougham, who
was thus the third cousin of Patrick Henry. To
some it will perhaps seem not a mere caprice of
ingenuity to discover in the fiery, eccentric, and
truculent eloquence of the great English advocate
and parliamentary orator a family likeness to that
of his renowned American kinsman; or to find in
the fierceness of the champion of Queen Caroline
against George IV., and of English anti-slavery reform
and of English parliamentary reform against
aristocratic and commercial selfishness, the same
bitter and eager radicalism that burned in the
blood of him who, on this side of the Atlantic,
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
was, in popular oratory, the great champion of the
colonies against George III., and afterward of
the political autonomy of the State of Virginia
against the all-dominating centralization which he
saw coiled up in the projected Constitution of the
United States.<a name="FNanchor2" id="FNanchor2"></a><a href="#Footnote-2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Those, however, who knew the mother of Patrick
Henry, and her family, the Winstons, were
accustomed to think that it was from her side of
the house that he derived the most characteristic
traits not only of his genius, but of his disposition.
The Winstons of Virginia were of Welsh stock;
a family marked by vivacity of spirit, conversational
talent, a lyric and dramatic turn, a gift for
music and for eloquent speech, at the same time
by a fondness for country life, for inartificial pleasures,
for fishing and hunting, for the solitude
and the unkempt charms of nature. It was said,
too, of the Winstons that their talents were in
excess of their ambition or of their energy, and
were not brought into use except in a fitful way,
and under the stimulus of some outward and passing
occasion. They seem to have belonged to that
very considerable class of persons in this world of
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
whom more might have been made. Especially
much talk used to be heard, among old men in
Virginia, of Patrick Henry&#8217;s uncle, his mother&#8217;s
own brother, William Winston, as having a gift
of eloquence dazzling and wondrous like Patrick&#8217;s,
nay, as himself unsurpassed in oratory among all
the great speakers of Virginia except by Patrick
himself.<a name="FNanchor3" id="FNanchor3"></a><a href="#Footnote-3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The system of education prevailing in Virginia
during Patrick Henry&#8217;s early years was extremely
simple. It consisted of an almost entire lack of
public schools, mitigated by the sporadic and irregular
exercise of domestic tuition. Those who
could afford to import instruction into their homes
got it, if they desired; those who could not, generally
went without. As to the youthful Patrick,
he and education never took kindly to each other.
From nearly all quarters the testimony is to this
effect,&mdash;that he was an indolent, dreamy, frolicsome
creature, with a mortal enmity to books,
supplemented by a passionate regard for fishing-rods
and shot-guns; disorderly in dress, slouching,
vagrant, unambitious; a roamer in woods, a loiterer
on river-banks; having more tastes and aspirations
in common with trappers and frontiersmen
than with the toilers of civilized life; giving no
hint nor token, by word or act, of the possession
of any intellectual gift that could raise him above
mediocrity, or even up to it.</p>

<p>During the first ten years of his life, he seems
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
to have made, at a small school in the neighborhood,
some small and reluctant progress into the
mysteries of reading, writing, and arithmetic;
whereupon his father took personal charge of the
matter, and conducted his further education at
home, along with that of other children, being
aided in the task by the very competent help of
a brother, the Rev. Patrick Henry, rector of St.
Paul&#8217;s parish, in Hanover, and apparently a good
Scotch classicist. In this way our Patrick acquired
some knowledge of Latin and Greek, and
rather more knowledge of mathematics,&mdash;the latter
being the only branch of book-learning for
which, in those days, he showed the least liking.
However, under such circumstances, with little
real discipline, doubtless, and amid plentiful interruptions,
the process of ostensible education
went forward with the young man; and even this
came to an end by the time that he was fifteen
years old.</p>

<p>At that age, he was duly graduated from the
domestic schoolroom into the shop of a country
tradesman hard by. After an apprenticeship there
of a single year, his father set him up in trade,
joining with him in the conduct of a country store
his elder brother, William, a youth more indolent,
if possible, as well as more disorderly and uncommercial,
than Patrick himself. One year of this
odd partnership brought the petty concern to its
inevitable fate. Just one year after that, having
attained the ripe age of eighteen, and being then
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
entirely out of employment, and equally out of
money, Patrick rounded out his embarrassments,
and gave symmetry to them, as it were, by getting
married,&mdash;and that to a young woman quite
as impecunious as himself. The name of this
damsel was Sarah Shelton; her father being a small
farmer, and afterward a small tavern-keeper in
the neighborhood. In the very rashness and absurdity
of this proceeding on the part of these two
interesting young paupers, irresistibly smitten with
each other&#8217;s charms, and mutually resolved to defy
their own helplessness by doubling it, there seems
to have been a sort of semi-ludicrous pathos which
constituted an irresistible call for help.</p>

<p>The parents on both sides heard the call, and by
their joint efforts soon established the young couple
on a little farm near at hand, from which, by
their own toil, re&euml;nforced by that of half a dozen
slaves, they were expected to extort a living. This
experiment, the success of which depended on exactly
those qualities which Patrick did not then
possess,&mdash;industry, order, sharp calculation, persistence,&mdash;turned
out as might have been predicted.
At the end of two years he made a forced
sale of some of his slaves, and invested the proceeds
in the stock of a country store once more.
But as he had now proved himself to be a bad
farmer, and a still worse merchant, it is not easy
to divine by what subtle process of reasoning he
had been able to conclude that there would be any
improvement in his circumstances by getting out
of agriculture and back into merchandise.
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>When he undertook this last venture he was
still but a youth of twenty. By the time that he
was twenty-three, that is, by the autumn of 1759,
he had become convinced that his little store was
to prove for him merely a consumer of capital and
a producer of bad debts; and in view of the necessity
of soon closing it, he had ample excuse for
taking into consideration what he should do next.
Already was he the happy father of sundry small
children, with the most trustworthy prospect of a
steady enlargement and multiplication of his paternal
honors. Surely, to a man of twenty-three, a
husband and a father, who, from the age of fifteen,
had been engaged in a series of enterprises
to gain his livelihood, and had perfectly failed in
every one of them, the question of his future
means of subsistence must have presented itself
as a subject of no little pertinence, not to say urgency.
However, at that time Patrick seems to
have been a young fellow of superabounding health
and of inextinguishable spirits, and even in that
crisis of his life he was able to deal gayly with
its problems. In that very year, 1759, Thomas
Jefferson, then a lad of sixteen, and on his way
to the College of William and Mary, happened
to spend the Christmas holidays at the house of
Colonel Nathan Dandridge, in Hanover, and there
first met Patrick Henry. Long afterward, recalling
these days, Jefferson furnished this picture of
him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Mr. Henry had, a little before, broken up his store, or<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
rather it had broken him up; but his misfortunes were
not to be traced either in his countenance or conduct.&#8221;
&#8220;During the festivity of the season I met him in society
every day, and we became well acquainted, although I
was much his junior.&hellip; His manners had something
of coarseness in them. His passion was music, dancing,
and pleasantry. He excelled in the last, and it attached
every one to him.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor4" id="FNanchor4"></a><a href="#Footnote-4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Shortly after Jefferson left those hilarious scenes
for the somewhat more restrained festivities of the
little college at Williamsburg, Patrick succeeded
in settling in his own mind what he was going to
do next. He could not dig, so it seemed, neither
could he traffic, but perhaps he could talk. Why
not get a living by his tongue? Why not be a
lawyer?</p>

<p>But before we follow him through the gates of
that superb profession,&mdash;gates which, after some
preliminary creaking of the hinges, threw open to
him the broad pathway to wealth, renown, unbounded
influence,&mdash;let us stop a moment longer
on the outside, and get a more distinct idea, if we
can, of his real intellectual outfit for the career on
which he was about to enter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II <br />
<span class="hsub">WAS HE ILLITERATE?</span></h2>


<p>Concerning the quality and extent of Patrick
Henry&#8217;s early education, it is perhaps impossible
now to speak with entire confidence. On the one
hand there seems to have been a tendency, in his
own time and since, to overstate his lack of education,
and this partly, it may be, from a certain
instinctive fascination which one finds in pointing
to so dramatic a contrast as that between the sway
which the great orator wielded over the minds of
other men and the untrained vigor and illiterate
spontaneity of his own mind. Then, too, it must
be admitted that, whatever early education Patrick
Henry may have received, he did, in certain companies
and at certain periods of his life, rather too
perfectly conceal it under an uncouth garb and
manner, and under a pronunciation which, to say
the least, was archaic and provincial. Jefferson
told Daniel Webster that Patrick Henry&#8217;s &#8220;pronunciation
was vulgar and vicious,&#8221; although, as
Jefferson adds, this &#8220;was forgotten while he was
speaking.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor5" id="FNanchor5"></a><a href="#Footnote-5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Governor John Page &#8220;used to relate,
on the testimony of his own ears,&#8221; that Patrick
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Henry would speak of &#8220;the yearth,&#8221; and of
&#8220;men&#8217;s naiteral parts being improved by
larnin&#8217;;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor6" id="FNanchor6"></a><a href="#Footnote-6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
while Spencer Roane mentions his pronunciation
of China as &#8220;Cheena.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor7" id="FNanchor7"></a><a href="#Footnote-7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
All this, however, it
should be noted, does not prove illiteracy. If,
indeed, such was his ordinary speech, and not, as
some have suggested, a manner adopted on particular
occasions for the purpose of identifying himself
with the mass of his hearers, the fact is evidence
merely that he retained through his mature
life, on the one hand, some relics of an old-fashioned
good usage, and, on the other, some traces
of the brogue of the district in which he was born,
just as Edmund Pendleton used to say &#8220;scaicely&#8221;
for scarcely, and as John Taylor, of Caroline,
would say &#8220;bare&#8221; for bar; just as Thomas Chalmers
always retained the brogue of Fifeshire, and
Thomas Carlyle that of Ecclefechan. Certainly
a brogue can never be elegant, but as it has many
times coexisted with very high intellectual cultivation,
its existence in Patrick Henry does not prove
him to have been uncultivated.</p>

<p>Then, too, it must be remembered that he himself
had a habit of depreciating his own acquaintance
with books, and his own dependence on them.
He did this, it would seem, partly from a consciousness
that it would only increase his hold on
the sympathy and support of the mass of the people
of Virginia if they should regard him as absolutely
one of themselves, and in no sense raised
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
above them by artificial advantages. Moreover,
this habit of self-depreciation would be brought
into play when he was in conversation with such
professed devourers of books as John Adams and
Jefferson, compared with whom he might very
properly feel an unfeigned conviction that he was
no reader at all,&mdash;a conviction in which they
would be quite likely to agree with him, and which
they would be very likely to express. Thus, John
Adams mentions that, in the first intimacy of their
friendship begun at the Congress of 1774, the
Virginian orator, at his lodgings, confessed one
night that, for himself, he had &#8220;had no public
education;&#8221; that at fifteen he had &#8220;read Virgil
and Livy,&#8221; but that he had &#8220;not looked into a
Latin book since.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor8" id="FNanchor8"></a><a href="#Footnote-8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Upon Jefferson, who of course
knew Henry far longer and far more closely, the
impression of his disconnection from books seems
to have been even more decided, especially if we
may accept the testimony of Jefferson&#8217;s old age,
when his memory had taken to much stumbling,
and his imagination even more to extravagance
than in his earlier life. Said Jefferson, in 1824,
of his ancient friend: &#8220;He was a man of very little
knowledge of any sort. He read nothing, and had
no books.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor9" id="FNanchor9"></a><a href="#Footnote-9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, there are certain facts concerning
Henry&#8217;s early education and intellectual
habits which may be regarded as pretty well established.
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Before the age of ten, at a petty neighborhood
school, he had got started upon the three
primary steps of knowledge. Then, from ten to
fifteen, whatever may have been his own irregularity
and disinclination, he was member of a home
school, under the immediate training of his father
and his uncle, both of them good Scotch classical
scholars, and one of them at least a proficient in
mathematics. No doubt the human mind, especially
in its best estate of juvenile vigor and frivolity,
has remarkable aptitude for the repulsion
of unwelcome knowledge; but it can hardly be
said that even Patrick Henry&#8217;s gift in that direction
could have prevented his becoming, under two
such masters, tolerably well grounded in Latin, if
not in Greek, or that the person who at fifteen is
able to read Virgil and Livy, no matter what may
be his subsequent neglect of Latin authors, is not
already imbued with the essential and indestructible
rudiments of the best intellectual culture.</p>

<p>It is this early initiation, on the basis of a drill
in Latin, into the art and mystery of expression,
which Patrick Henry received from masters so
competent and so deeply interested in him, which
helps us to understand a certain trait of his, which
puzzled Jefferson, and which, without this clue,
would certainly be inexplicable. From his first
appearance as a speaker to the end of his days, he
showed himself to be something more than a declaimer,&mdash;indeed,
an adept in language. &#8220;I have
been often astonished,&#8221; said Jefferson, &#8220;at his
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
command of proper language; how he obtained the
knowledge of it I never could find out, as he read
little, and conversed little with
educated men.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor10" id="FNanchor10"></a><a href="#Footnote-10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
It is true, probably, that we have no perfect report
of any speech he ever made; but even through
the obvious imperfections of his reporters there
always gleams a certain superiority in diction,&mdash;a
mastery of the logic and potency of fitting words;
such a mastery as genius alone, without special
training, cannot account for. Furthermore, we
have in the letters of his which survive, and which
of course were generally spontaneous and quite unstudied
effusions, absolutely authentic and literal
examples of his ordinary use of words. Some of
these letters will be found in the following pages.
Even as manuscripts, I should insist that the letters
of Patrick Henry are witnesses to the fact and
quality of real intellectual cultivation: these are
not the manuscripts of an uneducated person. In
penmanship, punctuation, spelling, syntax, they
are, upon the whole, rather better than the letters
of most of the great actors in our Revolution.
But, aside from the mere mechanics of written
speech, there is in the diction of Patrick Henry&#8217;s
letters the nameless felicity which, even with great
natural endowments, is only communicable by genuine
literary culture in some form. Where did
Patrick Henry get such literary culture? The
question can be answered only by pointing to that
painful drill in Latin which the book-hating boy
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
suffered under his uncle and his father, when, to
his anguish, Virgil and Livy detained him anon
from the true joys of existence.</p>

<p>Wirt seems to have satisfied himself, on evidence
carefully gathered from persons who were contemporaries
of Patrick Henry, that the latter had
received in his youth no mean classical education;
but, in the final revision of his book for publication,
Wirt abated his statements on that subject,
in deference to the somewhat vehement assertions
of Jefferson. It may be that, in its present lessened
form, Wirt&#8217;s account of the matter is the
more correct one; but this is the proper place in
which to mention one bit of direct testimony upon
the subject, which, probably, was not known to
Wirt. Patrick Henry is said to have told his
eldest grandson, Colonel Patrick Henry Fontaine,
that he was instructed by his uncle &#8220;not only in
the catechism, but in the Greek and Latin
classics.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor11" id="FNanchor11"></a><a href="#Footnote-11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
It may help us to realize something of
the moral stamina entering into the training which
the unfledged orator thus got that, as he related,
his uncle taught him these maxims of conduct:
&#8220;To be true and just in all my dealings. To bear
no malice nor hatred in my heart. To keep my
hands from picking and stealing. Not to covet
other men&#8217;s goods; but to learn and labor truly to
get my own living, and to do my duty in that state
of life unto which it shall please God to
call me.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor12" id="FNanchor12"></a><a href="#Footnote-12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Under such a teacher Patrick Henry was so
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
thoroughly grounded, at least in Latin and Greek
grammar, that when, long afterward, his eldest
grandson was a student in Hampden-Sidney College,
the latter found &#8220;his grandfather&#8217;s examinations
of his progress in Greek and Latin&#8221; so rigorous
that he dreaded them &#8220;much more than he
did his recitations to his
professors.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor13" id="FNanchor13"></a><a href="#Footnote-13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Colonel
Fontaine also states that he was present when a
certain French visitor, who did not speak English,
was introduced to Governor Henry, who did not
speak French. During the war of the Revolution
and just afterwards a similar embarrassment was
not infrequent here in the case of our public men,
among whom the study of French had been very
uncommon; and for many of them the old colonial
habit of fitting boys for college by training them
to the colloquial use of Latin proved to be a great
convenience. Colonel Fontaine&#8217;s anecdote implies,
what is altogether probable, that Patrick Henry&#8217;s
early drill in Latin had included the ordinary colloquial
use of it; for he says that in the case of
the visitor in question his grandfather was able,
by means of his early stock of Latin words, to
carry on the conversation in that
language.<a name="FNanchor14" id="FNanchor14"></a><a href="#Footnote-14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>This anecdote, implying Patrick Henry&#8217;s ability
to express himself in Latin, I give for what it may
be worth. Some will think it incredible, and that
impression will be further increased by the fact
that Colonel Fontaine names Albert Gallatin as
the visitor with whom, on account of his ignorance
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
of English, the conversation was thus carried on
in Latin. This, of course, must be a mistake;
for, at the time of his first visit to Virginia, Gallatin
could speak English very well, so well, in fact,
that he went to Virginia expressly as English interpreter
to a French gentleman who could not
speak our language.<a name="FNanchor15" id="FNanchor15"></a><a href="#Footnote-15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
However, as, during all
that period, Governor Henry had many foreign
visitors, Colonel Fontaine, in his subsequent account
of that particular visitor, might easily have
misplaced the name without thereby discrediting
the substance of his narrative. Indeed, the substance
of his narrative, namely, that he, Colonel
Fontaine, did actually witness, in the case of some
foreign visitor, such an exhibition of his grandfather&#8217;s
good early training in Latin, cannot be
rejected without an impeachment of the veracity
of the narrator, or at least of that of his son, who
has recorded the alleged incident. Of course, if
that narrative be accepted as substantially true, it
will be necessary to conclude that the Jeffersonian
tradition of Patrick Henry&#8217;s illiteracy is, at any
rate, far too highly tinted.</p>

<p>Thus far we have been dealing with the question
of Patrick Henry&#8217;s education down to the time of
his leaving school, at the age of fifteen. It was
not until nine years afterward that he began the
study of the law. What is the intellectual record
of these nine years? It is obvious that they were
years unfavorable to systematic training of any
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
sort, or to any regulated acquisition of knowledge.
During all that time in his life, as we now look
back upon it, he has for us the aspect of some lawless,
unkempt genius, in untoward circumstances,
groping in the dark, not without wild joy, towards
his inconceivable, true vocation; set to tasks for
which he was grotesquely unfit; blundering on
from misfortune to misfortune, with an overflow
of unemployed energy and vivacity that swept him
often into rough fun, into great gusts of innocent
riot and horseplay; withal borne along, for many
days together, by the mysterious undercurrents of
his nature, into that realm of reverie where the
soul feeds on immortal fruit and communes with
unseen associates, the body meanwhile being left
to the semblance of idleness; of all which the man
himself might have given this valid justification:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;I loafe and invite my soul,<br />
I lean and loafe at my ease, observing a spear of summer grass.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, these nine years of groping, blundering,
and seeming idleness were not without their
influence on his intellectual improvement even
through direct contact with books. While still a
boy in his teens, and put prematurely to uncongenial
attempts at shopkeeping and farmkeeping,
he at any rate made the great discovery that in
books and in the gathering of knowledge from
books could be found solace and entertainment; in
short, he then acquired a taste for reading. No
one pretends that Patrick Henry ever became a
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
bookish person. From the first and always the
habit of his mind was that of direct action upon
every subject that he had to deal with, through his
own reflection, and along the broad primary lines
of common sense. There is never in his thought
anything subtle or recondite,&mdash;no mental movement
through the media of books; but there is
good evidence for saying that this bewildered and
undeveloped youth, drifting about in chaos, did
in those days actually get a taste for reading, and
that he never lost it. The books which he first
read are vaguely described as &#8220;a few light and
elegant
authors,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor16" id="FNanchor16"></a><a href="#Footnote-16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
probably in English essays and
fiction. As the years passed and the boy&#8217;s mind
matured, he rose to more serious books. He became
fond of geography and of history, and he
pushed his readings, especially, into the history of
Greece and of Rome. He was particularly fascinated
by Livy, which he read in the English translation;
and then it was, as he himself related it to
Judge Hugh Nelson, that he made the rule to read
Livy through &#8220;once at least in every year during
the early part of his
life.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor17" id="FNanchor17"></a><a href="#Footnote-17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
He read also, it is
apparent, the history of England and of the English
colonies in America, and especially of his own
colony; for the latter finding, no doubt, in Beverley
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
and in the grave and noble pages of Stith, and
especially in the colonial charters given by Stith,
much material for those incisive opinions which he
so early formed as to the rights of the colonies,
and as to the barriers to be thrown up against the
encroaching authority of the mother country.</p>

<p>There is much contemporaneous evidence to show
that Patrick Henry was throughout life a deeply
religious person. It certainly speaks well for his
intellectual fibre, as well as for his spiritual tendencies,
that his favorite book, during the larger
part of his life, was &#8220;Butler&#8217;s Analogy,&#8221; which
was first published in the very year in which he
was born. It is possible that even during these
years of his early manhood he had begun his enduring
intimacy with that robust book. Moreover,
we can hardly err in saying that he had then also
become a steady reader of the English Bible, the
diction of which is stamped upon his style as unmistakably
as it is upon that of the elder Pitt.</p>

<p>Such, I think it may fairly be said, was Patrick
Henry when, at the age of twenty-four, having
failed in every other pursuit, he turned for bread
to the profession of the law. There is no evidence
that either he or any other mortal man was aware
of the extraordinary gifts that lay within him for
success in that career. Not a scholar surely, not
even a considerable miscellaneous reader, he yet
had the basis of a good education; he had the
habit of reading over and over again a few of the
best books; he had a good memory; he had an
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
intellect strong to grasp the great commanding
features of any subject; he had a fondness for the
study of human nature, and singular proficiency
in that branch of science; he had quick and warm
sympathies, particularly with persons in trouble,&mdash;an
invincible propensity to take sides with the
under-dog in any fight. Through a long experience
in offhand talk with the men whom he had
thus far chiefly known in his little provincial
world,&mdash;with an occasional clergyman, pedagogue,
or legislator, small planters and small traders,
sportsmen, loafers, slaves and the drivers of slaves,
and, more than all, those bucolic Solons of old
Virginia, the good-humored, illiterate, thriftless
Caucasian consumers of tobacco and whiskey, who,
cordially consenting that all the hard work of the
world should be done by the children of Ham,
were thus left free to commune together in endless
debate on the tavern porch or on the shady side
of the country store,&mdash;young Patrick had learned
somewhat of the lawyer&#8217;s art of putting things;
he could make men laugh, could make them serious,
could set fire to their enthusiasms. What
more he might do with such gifts nobody seems to
have guessed; very likely few gave it any thought
at all. In that rugged but munificent profession
at whose outward gates he then proceeded to knock,
it was altogether improbable that he would burden
himself with much more of its erudition than was
really necessary for a successful general practice
in Virginia in his time, or that he would permanently
content himself with less.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III <br />
<span class="hsub">BECOMES A LAWYER</span></h2>


<p>Some time in the early spring of 1760, Thomas
Jefferson, then a lad in the College of William and
Mary, was surprised by the arrival in Williamsburg
of his jovial acquaintance, Patrick Henry,
and still more by the announcement of the latter
that, in the brief interval since their merrymakings
together at Hanover, he had found time to study
law, and had actually come up to the capital to
seek an admission to the bar.</p>

<p>In the accounts that we have from Henry&#8217;s contemporaries
respecting the length of time during
which he was engaged in preparing for his legal
examination, there are certain discrepancies,&mdash;some
of these accounts saying that it was nine
months, others six or eight months, others six
weeks. Henry himself told a friend that his original
study of the law lasted only one month, and
consisted in the reading of Coke upon Littleton
and of the Virginia laws.<a name="FNanchor18" id="FNanchor18"></a><a href="#Footnote-18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Concerning the encounter of this obscure and
raw country youth with the accomplished men who
examined him as to his fitness to receive a license
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
to practice law, there are three primary narratives,&mdash;two
by Jefferson, and a third by Judge John
Tyler. In his famous talk with Daniel Webster
and the Ticknors at Monticello, in 1824, Jefferson
said: &#8220;There were four examiners,&mdash;Wythe, Pendleton,
Peyton Randolph, and John Randolph.
Wythe and Pendleton at once rejected his application;
the two Randolphs were, by his importunity,
prevailed upon to sign the license; and, having
obtained their signatures, he again applied to Pendleton,
and after much entreaty, and many promises
of future study, succeeded also in obtaining his.
He then turned out for a practicing lawyer.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor19" id="FNanchor19"></a><a href="#Footnote-19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>In a memorandum<a name="FNanchor20" id="FNanchor20"></a><a href="#Footnote-20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> prepared nearly ten years
before the conversation just mentioned, Jefferson
described somewhat differently the incidents of
Henry&#8217;s examination:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Two of the examiners, however, Peyton and John
Randolph, men of great facility of temper, signed his
license with as much reluctance as their dispositions
would permit them to show. Mr. Wythe absolutely
refused. Rob. C. Nicholas refused also at first; but on
repeated importunities, and promises of future reading,
he signed. These facts I had afterwards from the gentlemen
themselves; the two Randolphs acknowledging
he was very ignorant of law, but that they perceived
him to be a young man of genius, and did not doubt he
would soon qualify himself.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor21" id="FNanchor21"></a><a href="#Footnote-21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>
</div>


<p><span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>Long afterward, and when all this anxious affair
had become for Patrick Henry an amusing thing
of the past, he himself, in the confidence of an
affectionate friendship, seems to have related one
remarkable phase of his experience to Judge John
Tyler, by whom it was given to Wirt. One of
the examiners was &#8220;Mr. John Randolph, who was
afterwards the king&#8217;s attorney-general for the
colony,&mdash;a gentleman of the most courtly elegance
of person and manners, a polished wit, and a profound
lawyer. At first, he was so much shocked
by Mr. Henry&#8217;s very ungainly figure and address,
that he refused to examine him. Understanding,
however, that he had already obtained two signatures,
he entered with manifest reluctance on the
business. A very short time was sufficient to satisfy
him of the erroneous conclusion which he had
drawn from the exterior of the candidate. With
evident marks of increasing surprise (produced, no
doubt, by the peculiar texture and strength of Mr.
Henry&#8217;s style, and the boldness and originality of
his combinations), he continued the examination
for several hours; interrogating the candidate, not
on the principles of municipal law, in which he no
doubt soon discovered his deficiency, but on the
laws of nature and of nations, on the policy of the
feudal system, and on general history, which last
he found to be his stronghold. During the very
short portion of the examination which was devoted
to the common law, Mr. Randolph dissented, or
affected to dissent, from one of Mr. Henry&#8217;s answers,
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
and called upon him to assign the reasons
of his opinion. This produced an argument, and
Mr. Randolph now played off on him the same arts
which he himself had so often practiced on his
country customers; drawing him out by questions,
endeavoring to puzzle him by subtleties, assailing
him with declamation, and watching continually
the defensive operations of his mind. After a considerable
discussion, he said, &#8216;You defend your
opinions well, sir; but now to the law and to the
testimony.&#8217; Hereupon he carried him to his office,
and, opening the authorities, said to him: &#8216;Behold
the force of natural reason! You have never seen
these books, nor this principle of the law; yet you
are right and I am wrong. And from the lesson
which you have given me (you must excuse me for
saying it) I will never trust to appearances again.
Mr. Henry, if your industry be only half equal to
your genius, I augur that you will do well, and
become an ornament and an honor to your
profession.&#8217;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor22" id="FNanchor22"></a><a href="#Footnote-22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>After such an ordeal at Williamsburg, the young
man must have ridden back to Hanover with some
natural elation over his success, but that elation
not a little tempered by serious reflection upon his
own deficiencies as a lawyer, and by an honest
purpose to correct them. Certainly nearly everything
that was dear to him in life must then have
risen before his eyes, and have incited him to industry
in the further study of his profession.<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>At that time, his father-in-law had become the
keeper of a tavern in Hanover; and for the next
two or three years, while he was rapidly making
his way as a general practitioner of the law in that
neighborhood, Patrick seems occasionally to have
been a visitor at this tavern. It was in this way,
undoubtedly, that he sometimes acted as host, especially
in the absence of his father-in-law,&mdash;receiving
all comers, and providing for their entertainment;
and it was from this circumstance that
the tradition arose, as Jefferson bluntly expressed
it, that Patrick Henry &#8220;was originally a
barkeeper,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor23" id="FNanchor23"></a><a href="#Footnote-23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
or, as it is more vivaciously expressed
by a recent writer, that &#8220;for three years&#8221; after
getting his license to practice law, he &#8220;tended
travelers and drew
corks.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor24" id="FNanchor24"></a><a href="#Footnote-24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>These statements, however, are but an exaggeration
of the fact that, whenever visiting at the tavern
of his father-in-law, he had the good sense and
the good feeling to lend a hand, in case of need,
in the business of the house; and that no more
than this is true may be proved, not only from
the written testimony of
survivors,<a name="FNanchor25" id="FNanchor25"></a><a href="#Footnote-25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
who knew him
in those days, but from the contemporary records,
carefully kept by himself, of his own earliest business
as a lawyer. These records show that, almost
at once after receiving his license to practice law,
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
he must have been fully occupied with the appropriate
business of his profession.</p>

<p>It is quite apparent, also, from the evidence just
referred to, that the common history of his life
has, in another particular, done great injustice to
this period of it. According to the recollection of
one old man who outlived him, &#8220;he was not distinguished
at the bar for near four
years.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor26" id="FNanchor26"></a><a href="#Footnote-26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
Wirt
himself, relying upon the statements of several
survivors of Patrick Henry, speaks of his lingering
&#8220;in the background for three years,&#8221; and of
&#8220;the profits of his practice&#8221; as being so inadequate
for the supply of even &#8220;the necessaries of life,&#8221;
that &#8220;for the first two or three years&#8221; he was living
with his family in dependence upon his
father-in-law.<a name="FNanchor27" id="FNanchor27"></a><a href="#Footnote-27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
Fortunately, however, we are not left in
this case to grope our way toward the truth amid
the ruins of the confused and decaying memories
of old men. Since Wirt&#8217;s time, there have come
to light the fee-books of Patrick Henry, carefully
and neatly kept by him from the beginning of his
practice, and covering nearly his entire professional
life down to old
age.<a name="FNanchor28" id="FNanchor28"></a><a href="#Footnote-28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
The first entry in
these books is for September, 1760; and from that
date onward to the end of the year 1763,&mdash;by
which time he had suddenly sprung into great
professional prominence by his speech in &#8220;the
Parsons&#8217; Cause,&#8221;&mdash;he is found to have charged
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
fees in 1185 suits, besides many other fees for the
preparation of legal papers out of court. From
about the time of his speech in &#8220;the Parsons&#8217;
Cause,&#8221; as his fee-books show, his practice became
enormous, and so continued to the end of his days,
excepting when public duties or broken health
compelled him to turn away clients. Thus it is
apparent that, while the young lawyer did not
attain anything more than local professional reputation
until his speech against the parsons, he did
acquire a very considerable practice almost immediately
after his admission to the bar. Moreover,
so far from his being a needy dependent on his
father-in-law for the first two or three years, the
same quiet records show that his practice enabled
him, even during that early period, to assist his
father-in-law by an important advance of money.</p>

<p>The fiction that Patrick Henry, during the first
three or four years of his nominal career as a lawyer,
was a briefless barrister,&mdash;earning his living
at the bar of a tavern rather than at the bar of
justice,&mdash;is the very least of those disparaging
myths, which, through the frailty of human memory
and the bitterness of partisan ill-will, have
been permitted to settle upon his reputation.
Certainly, no one would think it discreditable, or
even surprising, if Patrick Henry, while still a
very young lawyer, should have had little or no
practice, provided only that, when the practice
did come, the young lawyer had shown himself to
have been a good one. It is precisely this
honor
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
which, during the past seventy years, has been
denied him. Upon the evidence thus far most
prominently before the public, one is compelled to
conceive of him as having been destitute of nearly
all the qualifications of a good lawyer, excepting
those which give success with juries, particularly
in criminal practice: he is represented as ignorant
of the law, indolent, and grossly negligent of business,&mdash;with
nothing, in fact, to give him the least
success in the profession but an abnormal and
quite unaccountable gift of persuasion through
speech.</p>

<p>Referring to this period of his life, Wirt says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Of the science of law he knew almost nothing; of
the practical part he was so wholly ignorant that he was
not only unable to draw a declaration or a plea, but incapable,
it is said, of the most common or simple business
of his profession, even of the mode of ordering a
suit, giving a notice, or making a motion in
court.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor29" id="FNanchor29"></a><a href="#Footnote-29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This conception of Henry&#8217;s professional character,
to which Wirt seems to have come reluctantly, was
founded, as is now evident, on the long-suppressed
memorandum of Jefferson, who therein states that,
after failing in merchandise, Patrick &#8220;turned his
views to the law, for the acquisition or practice of
which however, he was too lazy. Whenever the
courts were closed for the winter session, he would
make up a party of poor hunters of his neighborhood,
would go off with them to the piny woods of
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Fluvanna, and pass weeks in hunting deer, of
which he was passionately fond, sleeping under a
tent before a fire, wearing the same shirt the whole
time, and covering all the dirt of his dress with
a hunting-shirt. He never undertook to draw
pleadings, if he could avoid it, or to manage that
part of a cause, and very unwillingly engaged but
as an assistant to speak in the cause. And the
fee was an indispensable preliminary, observing to
the applicant that he kept no accounts, never putting
pen to paper, which was true.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor30" id="FNanchor30"></a><a href="#Footnote-30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The last sentence of this passage, in which Jefferson
declares that it was true that Henry &#8220;kept
no accounts, never putting pen to paper,&#8221; is, of
course, now utterly set aside by the discovery of
the precious fee-books; and these orderly and circumstantial
records almost as completely annihilate
the trustworthiness of all the rest of the passage.
Let us consider, for example, Jefferson&#8217;s statement
that for the acquisition of the law, or for the practice
of it, Henry was too lazy, and that much of
the time between the sessions of the courts was
passed by him in deer-hunting in the woods.
Confining ourselves to the first three and a half
years of his actual practice, in which, by the record,
his practice was the smallest that he ever had,
it is not easy for one to understand how a mere
novice in the profession, and one so perfectly ignorant
of its most rudimental forms, could have
earned, during that brief period, the fees which he
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
charged in 1185 suits, and in the preparation of
many legal papers out of court, and still have been
seriously addicted to laziness. Indeed, if so much
legal business could have been transacted within
three years and a half, by a lawyer who, besides
being young and incompetent, was also extremely
lazy, and greatly preferred to go off to the woods
and hunt for deer while his clients were left to
hunt in vain for him, it becomes an interesting
question just how much legal business we ought to
expect to be done by a young lawyer who was not
incompetent, was not lazy, and had no inordinate
fondness for deer-hunting. It happens that young
Thomas Jefferson himself was just such a lawyer.
He began practice exactly seven years after Patrick
Henry, and at precisely the same time of life,
though under external circumstances far more favorable.
As a proof of his uncommon zeal and success
in the profession, his biographer, Randall,
cites from Jefferson&#8217;s fee-books the number of
cases in which he was employed until he was finally
drawn off from the law into political life. Oddly
enough, for the first four years of his practice,
the cases registered by Jefferson<a name="FNanchor31" id="FNanchor31"></a><a href="#Footnote-31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> number, in all,
but 504. It should be mentioned that this number,
as it includes only Jefferson&#8217;s cases in the
General Court, does not indicate all the business
done by him during those first four years; and
yet, even with this allowance, we are left standing
rather helpless before the problem presented by
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
the fact that this competent and diligent young
lawyer&mdash;whom, forsooth, the rustling leaves of
the forest could never for once entice from the
rustle of the leaves of his law-books&mdash;did nevertheless
transact, during his own first four years of
practice, probably less than one half as much business
as seems to have been done during a somewhat
shorter space of time by our poor, ignorant,
indolent, slovenly, client-shunning and forest-haunting
Patrick.</p>

<p>But, if Jefferson&#8217;s charge of professional indolence
and neglect on the part of his early friend
fares rather ill when tested by those minute and
plodding records of his professional employments
which were kept by Patrick Henry, a fate not
much more prosperous overtakes Jefferson&#8217;s other
charge,&mdash;that of professional incompetence. It
is more than intimated by Jefferson that, even had
Patrick been disposed to engage in a general law
practice, he did not know enough to do so successfully
by reason of his ignorance of the most ordinary
legal principles and legal forms. But the
intellectual embarrassment which one experiences
in trying to accept this view of Patrick Henry
arises from the simple fact that these incorrigible
fee-books show that it was precisely this general
law practice that he did engage in, both in court
and out of court; a practice only a small portion
of which was criminal, the larger part of it consisting
of the ordinary suits in country litigation; a
practice which certainly involved the drawing of
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
pleadings, and the preparation of many sorts of
legal papers; a practice, moreover, which he seems
to have acquired with extraordinary rapidity, and
to have maintained with increasing success as long
as he cared for it. These are items of history
which are likely to burden the ordinary reader
with no little perplexity,&mdash;a perplexity the elements
of which are thus modestly stated by a living
grandson of Patrick Henry: &#8220;How he acquired or
retained a practice so large and continually increasing,
so perfectly unfit for it as Mr. Jefferson
represents him, I am at a loss to understand.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor32" id="FNanchor32"></a><a href="#Footnote-32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>As we go further in the study of this man&#8217;s life,
we shall have before us ample materials for dealing
still further and still more definitely with the
subject of his professional character, as that character
itself became developed and matured. Meantime,
however, the evidence already in view seems
quite enough to enable us to form a tolerably clear
notion of the sort of lawyer he was down to the
end of 1763, which may be regarded as the period
of his novitiate at the bar. It is perfectly evident
that, at the time of his admission to the bar, he
knew very little of the law, either in its principles
or in its forms: he knew no more than could have
been learned by a young man of genius in the
course of four weeks in the study of Coke upon
Littleton, and of the laws of Virginia. If, now,
we are at liberty to suppose that his study of the
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
law then ceased, we may accept the view of his
professional incompetence held up by Jefferson;
but precisely that is what we are not at liberty to
suppose. All the evidence, fairly sifted, warrants
the belief that, on his return to Hanover with his
license to practice law, he used the next few months
in the further study of it; and that thenceforward,
just so fast as professional business came to his
hands, he tried to qualify himself to do that business,
and to do it so well that his clients should
be inclined to come to him again in case of need.
Patrick Henry&#8217;s is not the first case, neither is it
the last one, of a man coming to the bar miserably
unqualified for its duties, but afterward becoming
well qualified. We need not imagine, we do not
imagine, that he ever became a man of great learning
in the law; but we do find it impossible to
believe that he continued to be a man of great
ignorance in it. The law, indeed, is the one profession
on earth in which such success as he is
proved to have had, is impossible to such incompetence
as he is said to have had. Moreover, in
trying to form a just idea of Patrick Henry, it is
never safe to forget that we have to do with a man
of genius, and that the ways by which a man of
genius reaches his results are necessarily his own,&mdash;are
often invisible, are always somewhat mysterious,
to the rest of us. The genius of Patrick
Henry was powerful, intuitive, swift; by a glance
of the eye he could take in what an ordinary man
might spend hours in toiling for; his memory held
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
whatever was once committed to it; all his resources
were at instant command; his faculty for
debate, his imagination, humor, tact, diction, elocution,
were rich and exquisite; he was also a man
of human and friendly ways, whom all men loved,
and whom all men wanted to help; and it would
not have been strange if he actually fitted himself
for the successful practice of such law business as
was then to be had in Virginia, and actually entered
upon its successful practice with a quickness
the exact processes of which were unperceived even
by his nearest neighbors.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV <br />
<span class="hsub">A CELEBRATED CASE</span></h2>


<p>Thus Patrick Henry had been for nearly four
years in the practice of the law, with a vigor and a
success quite extraordinary, when, late in the year
1763, he became concerned in a case so charged
with popular interest, and so well suited to the
display of his own marvellous genius as an advocate,
as to make both him and his case immediately
celebrated.</p>

<p>The side upon which he was retained happened
to be the wrong side,&mdash;wrong both in law and in
equity; having only this element of strength in it,
namely, that by a combination of circumstances
there were enlisted in its favor precisely those
passions of the multitude which are the most selfish,
the most blinding, and at the same time the
most energetic. It only needed an advocate skilful
enough to play effectively upon these passions,
and a storm would be raised before which mere
considerations of law and of equity would be swept
out of sight.</p>

<p>In order to understand the real issue presented
by &#8220;the Parsons&#8217; Cause,&#8221; and consequently the
essential weakness of the side to the service of
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
which our young lawyer was now summoned, we
shall need to turn about and take a brief tour into
the earlier history of Virginia. In that colony,
from the beginning, the Church of England was
established by law, and was supported, like any
other institution of the government, by revenues
derived from taxation,&mdash;taxation levied in this
case upon nearly all persons in the colony above
the age of sixteen years. Moreover, those local
subdivisions which, in the Northern colonies, were
called towns, in Virginia were called parishes; and
accordingly, in the latter, the usual local officers
who manage the public business for each civil
neighborhood were called, not selectmen or supervisors,
as at the North, but vestrymen. Among
the functions conferred by the law upon these local
officers in Virginia was that of hiring the rector or
minister, and of paying him his salary; and the
same authority which gave to the vestry this power
fixed likewise the precise amount of salary which
they were to pay. Ever since the early days of
the colony, this amount had been stated, not in
money, which hardly existed there, but in tobacco,
which was the staple of the colony. Sometimes
the market value of tobacco would be very low,&mdash;so
low that the portion paid to the minister would
yield a sum quite insufficient for his support; and
on such occasions, prior to 1692, the parishes had
often kindly made up for such depreciation by
voluntarily paying an extra quantity of tobacco.<a name="FNanchor33" id="FNanchor33"></a><a href="#Footnote-33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a><span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
After 1692, however, for reasons which need not
now be detailed, this generous custom seems to
have disappeared. For example, from 1709 to
1714, the price of tobacco was so low as to make
its shipment to England, in many instances, a
positive loss to its owner; while the sale of it on
the spot was so disadvantageous as to reduce the
minister&#8217;s salary to about &pound;25 a year, as reckoned
in the depreciated paper currency of the colony.
Of course, during those years, the distress of the
clergy was very great; but, whatever it may have
been, they were permitted to bear it, without any
suggestion, either from the legislature or from the
vestries, looking toward the least addition to the
quantity of tobacco then to be paid them. On
the other hand, from 1714 to 1720, the price of
tobacco rose considerably above the average, and
did something towards making up to the clergy the
losses which they had recently incurred. Then,
again, from 1720 to 1724, tobacco fell to the low
price of the former period, and of course with the
same results of unrelieved loss to the clergy.<a name="FNanchor34" id="FNanchor34"></a><a href="#Footnote-34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Thus, however, in the process of time, there had
become established, in the fiscal relations of each
vestry to its minister, a rough but obvious system
of fair play. When the price of tobacco was
down, the parson was expected to suffer the loss;
when the price of tobacco was up, he was allowed
to enjoy the gain. Probably it did not then occur
to any one that a majority of the good people of
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Virginia could ever be brought to demand such a
mutilation of justice as would be involved in depriving
the parson of the occasional advantage of
a very good market, and of making up for this by
always leaving to him the undisturbed enjoyment
of every occasional bad one. Yet it was just this
mutilation of justice which, only a few years later,
a majority of the good people of Virginia were
actually brought to demand, and which, by the
youthful genius of Patrick Henry, they were too
well aided in effecting.</p>

<p>Returning now from our brief tour into a period
of Virginian history just prior to that upon which
we are at present engaged, we find ourselves arrived
at the year 1748, in which year the legislature
of Virginia, revising all previous regulations
respecting the hiring and paying of the clergy,
passed an act, directing that every parish minister
should &#8220;receive an annual salary of 16,000 pounds
of tobacco, &hellip; to be levied, assessed, collected,
and paid&#8221; by the vestry. &#8220;And if the vestry of
any parish&#8221; should &#8220;neglect or refuse to levy the
tobacco due to the minister,&#8221; they should &#8220;be liable
to the action of the party grieved &hellip; for
all damages which he &hellip; shall sustain by such
refusal or
neglect.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor35" id="FNanchor35"></a><a href="#Footnote-35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
This act of the colonial legislature,
having been duly approved by the king,
became a law, and consequently was not liable to
repeal or even to suspension except by the king&#8217;s
approval. Thus, at the period now reached, there
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
was between every vestry and its minister a valid
contract for the annual payment, by the former to
the latter, of that particular quantity of tobacco,&mdash;the
clergy to take their chances as to the market
value of the product from year to year.</p>

<p>Thus matters ran on until 1755, when, by reason
of a diminished crop of tobacco, the legislature
passed an option
law,<a name="FNanchor36" id="FNanchor36"></a><a href="#Footnote-36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
virtually suspending for
the next ten months the Act of 1748, and requiring
the clergy, at the option of the vestries, to
receive their salaries for that year, not in tobacco,
but in the depreciated paper currency of the colony,
at the rate of two pence for each pound of
tobacco due,&mdash;a price somewhat below the market
value of the article for that year. Most clearly
this act, which struck an arbitrary blow at the
validity of all contracts in Virginia, was one which
exceeded the constitutional authority of the legislature;
since it suspended, without the royal approval,
a law which had been regularly ratified by
the king. However, the operation of this act was
shrewdly limited to ten months,&mdash;a period just
long enough to accomplish its object, but too short
for the royal intervention against it to be of any
direct avail. Under these circumstances, the clergy
bore their losses for that year with some murmuring
indeed, but without any formal
protest.<a name="FNanchor37" id="FNanchor37"></a><a href="#Footnote-37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
</p>

<p>Just three years afterward, in 1758, the legislature,
with even less excuse than before, passed an
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
act<a name="FNanchor38" id="FNanchor38"></a><a href="#Footnote-38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
similar to that of 1755,&mdash;its force, however,
being limited to twelve months. The operation of
this act, as affecting each parish minister, may be
conveyed in very few words. In lieu of what was
due him under the law for his year&#8217;s services,
namely, 16,000 pounds of tobacco, the market
value of which for the year in question proved to
be about &pound;400 sterling, it compelled him to take,
in the paper money of the colony, the sum of about
&pound;133. To make matters still worse, while the
tobacco which was due him was an instant and an
advantageous medium of exchange everywhere,
and especially in England whence nearly all his
merchant supplies were obtained, this paper money
that was forced upon him was a depreciated currency
even within the colony, and absolutely worthless
outside of it; so that the poor parson, who
could never demand his salary for any year until
six full months after its close, would have proffered
to him, at the end, perhaps, of another six months,
just one third of the nominal sum due him, and
that in a species of money of no value at all except
in Virginia, and even in Virginia of a purchasing
value not exceeding that of &pound;20 sterling in
England.<a name="FNanchor39" id="FNanchor39"></a><a href="#Footnote-39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
</p>

<p>Nor, in justification of such a measure, could it
be truthfully said that there was at that time in
the colony any general &#8220;dearth and
scarcity,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor40" id="FNanchor40"></a><a href="#Footnote-40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
or
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
any such public distress of any sort as might overrule
the ordinary maxims of justice, and excuse,
in the name of humanity, a merely technical violation
of law. As a matter of fact, the only &#8220;dearth
and scarcity&#8221; in Virginia that year was &#8220;confined
to one or two counties on James River, and that
entirely owing to their own
fault;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor41" id="FNanchor41"></a><a href="#Footnote-41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
wherever
there was any failure of the tobacco crop, it was
due to the killing of the plants so early in the
spring, that such land did not need to lie uncultivated,
and in most cases was planted &#8220;in corn and
pease, which always turned to good
account;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor42" id="FNanchor42"></a><a href="#Footnote-42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
and although, for the whole colony, the crop of
tobacco &#8220;was short in quantity,&#8221; yet &#8220;in cash
value it proved to be the best crop that Virginia
had ever had&#8221; since the settlement of the
colony.<a name="FNanchor43" id="FNanchor43"></a><a href="#Footnote-43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
Finally, it was by no means the welfare of the
poor that &#8220;was the object, or the effect, of the
law;&#8221; but it was &#8220;the rich planters&#8221; who, first
selling their tobacco at about fifty shillings the
hundred, and then paying to the clergy and others
their tobacco debts at the rate of sixteen shillings
the hundred, were &#8220;the chief gainers&#8221; by the
act.<a name="FNanchor44" id="FNanchor44"></a><a href="#Footnote-44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
</p>

<p>Such, then, in all its fresh and unadorned rascality,
was the famous &#8220;option law,&#8221; or &#8220;two-penny
act,&#8221; of 1758: an act firmly opposed, on its
first appearance in the legislature, by a noble
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
minority of honorable men; an act clearly indicating
among a portion of the people of Virginia a
survival of the old robber instincts of our Norse
ancestors; an act having there the sort of frantic
popularity that all laws are likely to have which
give a dishonest advantage to the debtor class,&mdash;and
in Virginia, unfortunately, on the subject of
salaries due to the clergy, nearly all persons above
sixteen years of age belonged to that
class.<a name="FNanchor45" id="FNanchor45"></a><a href="#Footnote-45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
</p>

<p>At the time when this act was before the legislature
for consideration, the clergy applied for a
hearing, but were refused. Upon its passage by
the two houses, the clergy applied to the acting
governor, hoping to obtain his disapproval of the
act; but his reply was an unblushing avowal of
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
his determination to pursue any course, right or
wrong, which would bring him popular favor.
They then sent one of their own number to England,
for the purpose of soliciting the royal disallowance
of the act. After a full hearing of both
sides, the privy council gave it as their opinion
that the clergy of Virginia had their &#8220;certain
remedy at law;&#8221; Lord Hardwicke, in particular,
declaring that &#8220;there was no occasion to dispute
about the authority by which the act was passed;
for that no court in the judicature whatever could
look upon it to be law, by reason of its manifest
injustice
alone.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor46" id="FNanchor46"></a><a href="#Footnote-46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
Accordingly, the royal disallowance
was granted. Upon the arrival in Virginia
of these tidings, several of the clergy began
suits against their respective vestries, for the purpose
of compelling them to pay the amounts then
legally due upon their salaries for the year 1758.</p>

<p>Of these suits, the first to come to trial was that
of the Rev. Thomas Warrington, in the County
Court of Elizabeth City. In that case, &#8220;a jury
of his own parishioners found for him considerable
damages, allowing on their oaths that there was
above twice as much justly due to him as the act
had granted;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor47" id="FNanchor47"></a><a href="#Footnote-47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
but &#8220;the court hindered him from
immediately coming at the damages, by judging
the act to be law, in which it is thought they were
influenced more by the fear of giving offense to
their superiors, than by their own opinion of the
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
reasonableness of the act,&mdash;they privately professing
that they thought the parson ought to have
his right.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor48" id="FNanchor48"></a><a href="#Footnote-48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
</p>

<p>Soon afterward came to trial, in the court of
King William County, the suit of the Rev. Alexander
White, rector of St. David&#8217;s parish. In
this case, the court, instead of either sustaining or
rejecting the disallowed act, simply shirked their
responsibility, &#8220;refused to meddle in the matter,
and insisted on leaving the whole affair to the
jury;&#8221; who being thus freed from all judicial control,
straightway rendered a verdict of neat and
comprehensive lawlessness: &#8220;We bring in for the
defendant.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor49" id="FNanchor49"></a><a href="#Footnote-49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
</p>

<p>It was at this stage of affairs that the court of
Hanover County reached the case of the Rev.
James Maury, rector of Fredericksville parish,
Louisa; and the court, having before it the evidence
of the royal disallowance of the Act of 1758,
squarely &#8220;adjudged the act to be no law.&#8221; Of
course, under this decision, but one result seemed
possible. As the court had thus rejected the validity
of the act whereby the vestry had withheld
from their parson two thirds of his salary for the
year 1758, it only remained to summon a special
jury on a writ of inquiry to determine the damages
thus sustained by the parson; and as this was a
very simple question of arithmetic, the counsel for
the defendants expressed his desire to withdraw
from the case.
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Such was the situation, when these defendants,
having been assured by their counsel that all further
struggle would be hopeless, turned for help
to the enterprising young lawyer who, in that very
place, had been for the previous three and a half
years pushing his way to notice in his profession.
To him, accordingly, they brought their cause,&mdash;a
desperate cause, truly,&mdash;a cause already lost
and abandoned by veteran and eminent counsel.
Undoubtedly, by the ethics of his profession, Patrick
Henry was bound to accept the retainer that
was thus tendered him; and, undoubtedly, by the
organization of his own mind, having once accepted
that retainer, he was likely to devote to the cause
no tepid or half-hearted service.</p>

<p>The decision of the court, which has been referred
to, was rendered at its November session.
On the first day of the session in December, the
order was executed for summoning a select jury
&#8220;to examine whether the plaintiff had sustained
any damages, and
what.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor50" id="FNanchor50"></a><a href="#Footnote-50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
Obviously, in the determination
of these two questions, much would
depend on the personal composition of the jury;
and it is apparent that this matter was diligently
attended to by the sheriff. His plan seems to
have been to secure a good, honest jury of twelve
adult male persons, but without having among
them a single one of those over-scrupulous and
intractable people who, in Virginia, at that time,
were still technically described as gentlemen.
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
With what delicacy and efficiency he managed this
part of the business was thus described shortly afterward
by the plaintiff, of course a deeply interested
eye-witness:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The sheriff went into a public room full of gentlemen,
and told his errand. One excused himself &hellip; as
having already given his opinion in a similar case. On
this, &hellip; he immediately left the room, without summoning
any one person there. He afterwards met another
gentleman &hellip; on the green, and, on saying he
was not fit to serve, being a church warden, he took upon
himself to excuse him, too, and, as far as I can learn
made no further attempts to summon gentlemen.&hellip; Hence
he went among the vulgar herd. After he had
selected and set down upon his list about eight or ten of
these, I met him with it in his hand, and on looking
over it, observed to him that they were not such jurors
as the court had directed him to get,&mdash;being people of
whom I had never heard before, except one whom, I told
him, he knew to be a party in the cause.&hellip; Yet this
man&#8217;s name was not erased. He was even called in
court, and had he not excused himself, would probably
have been admitted. For I cannot recollect that the
court expressed either surprise or dislike that a more
proper jury had not been summoned. Nay, though I
objected against them, yet, as Patrick Henry, one of the
defendants&#8217; lawyers, insisted they were honest men, and,
therefore, unexceptionable, they were immediately called
to the book and
sworn.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor51" id="FNanchor51"></a><a href="#Footnote-51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>Having thus secured a jury that must have been
reasonably satisfactory to the defendants, the hearing
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
began. Two gentlemen, being the largest purchasers
of tobacco in the county, were then sworn
as witnesses to prove the market price of the article
in 1759. By their testimony it was established
that the price was then more than three times as
much as had been estimated in the payment of
paper money actually made to the plaintiff in that
year. Upon this state of facts, &#8220;the lawyers on
both sides&#8221; proceeded to display &#8220;the force and
weight of the evidence;&#8221; after which the case was
given to the jury. &#8220;In less than five minutes,&#8221;
they &#8220;brought in a verdict for the plaintiff,&mdash;one
penny damages.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor52" id="FNanchor52"></a><a href="#Footnote-52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
</p>

<p>Just how the jury were induced, in the face of
the previous judgment of that very court, to render
this astounding verdict, has been described in
two narratives: one by William Wirt, written
about fifty years after the event; the other by the
injured plaintiff himself, the Rev. James Maury,
written exactly twelve days after the event. Few
things touching the life of Patrick Henry can be
more notable or more instructive than the contrast
presented by these two narratives.</p>

<p>On reaching the scene of action, on the 1st of
December, Patrick Henry &#8220;found,&#8221; says Wirt,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;on the courtyard such a concourse as would have appalled
any other man in his situation. They were not people
of the county merely who were there, but visitors from
all the counties to a considerable distance around. The
decision upon the demurrer had produced a violent ferment
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
among the people, and equal exultation on the
part of the clergy, who attended the court in a large
body, either to look down opposition, or to enjoy the
final triumph of this hard fought contest, which they
now considered as perfectly secure.&hellip; Soon after the
opening of the court the cause was called.&hellip; The
array before Mr. Henry&#8217;s eyes was now most fearful.
On the bench sat more than twenty clergymen, the most
learned men in the colony.&hellip; The courthouse was
crowded with an overwhelming multitude, and surrounded
with an immense and anxious throng, who, not
finding room to enter, were endeavoring to listen without
in the deepest attention. But there was something
still more awfully disconcerting than all this; for in the
chair of the presiding magistrate sat no other person
than his own father. Mr. Lyons opened the cause very
briefly.&hellip; And now came on the first trial of Patrick
Henry&#8217;s strength. No one had ever heard him
speak,<a name="FNanchor53" id="FNanchor53"></a><a href="#Footnote-53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
and curiosity was on tiptoe. He rose very awkwardly,
and faltered much in his exordium. The people hung
their heads at so unpromising a commencement; the
clergy were observed to exchange sly looks with each
other; and his father is described as having almost
sunk with confusion, from his seat. But these feelings
were of short duration, and soon gave place to others
of a very different character. For now were those wonderful
faculties which he possessed, for the first time
developed; and now was first witnessed that mysterious
and almost supernatural transformation of appearance,
which the fire of his own eloquence never failed to work
in him. For as his mind rolled along, and began to
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
glow from its own action, all the exuvi&aelig; of the clown
seemed to shed themselves spontaneously. His attitude,
by degrees, became erect and lofty. The spirit of his
genius awakened all his features. His countenance
shone with a nobleness and grandeur which it had never
before exhibited. There was a lightning in his eyes
which seemed to rive the spectator. His action became
graceful, bold, and commanding; and in the tones of
his voice, but more especially in his emphasis, there was
a peculiar charm, a magic, of which any one who ever
heard him will speak as soon as he is named, but of
which no one can give any adequate description. They
can only say that it struck upon the ear and upon the
heart, in a manner which language cannot tell. Add to
all these, his wonder-working fancy, and the peculiar
phraseology in which he clothed its images: for he
painted to the heart with a force that almost petrified it.
In the language of those who heard him on this occasion,
&#8216;he made their blood run cold, and their hair to
rise on end.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will not be difficult for any one who ever heard
this most extraordinary man, to believe the whole account
of this transaction which is given by his surviving
hearers; and from their account, the court house of
Hanover County must have exhibited, on this occasion,
a scene as picturesque as has been ever witnessed in
real life. They say that the people, whose countenance
had fallen as he arose, had heard but a very few sentences
before they began to look up; then to look at
each other with surprise, as if doubting the evidence
of their own senses; then, attracted by some strong gesture,
struck by some majestic attitude, fascinated by the
spell of his eye, the charm of his emphasis, and the
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
varied and commanding expression of his countenance,
they could look away no more. In less than twenty
minutes, they might be seen in every part of the house,
on every bench, in every window, stooping forward from
their stands, in death-like silence; their features fixed
in amazement and awe; all their senses listening and
riveted upon the speaker, as if to catch the least strain
of some heavenly visitant. The mockery of the clergy
was soon turned into alarm; their triumph into confusion
and despair; and at one burst of his rapid and
overwhelming invective, they fled from the house in precipitation
and terror. As for the father, such was his
surprise, such his amazement, such his rapture, that, forgetting
where he was, and the character which he was
filling, tears of ecstasy streamed down his cheeks, without
the power or inclination to repress them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The jury seem to have been so completely bewildered,
that they lost sight not only of the Act of 1748,
but that of 1758 also; for, thoughtless even of the admitted
right of the plaintiff, they had scarcely left the
bar, when they returned with a verdict of one penny
damages. A motion was made for a new trial; but the
court, too, had now lost the equipoise of their judgment,
and overruled the motion by an unanimous vote. The
verdict and judgment overruling the motion were followed
by redoubled acclamations, from within and without
the house. The people, who had with difficulty
kept their hands off their champion from the moment
of closing his harangue, no sooner saw the fate of the
cause finally sealed, than they seized him at the bar;
and in spite of his own exertions, and the continued cry
of order from the sheriffs and the court, they bore him
out of the courthouse, and raising him on their shoulders,
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
carried him about the yard, in a kind of electioneering
triumph.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor54" id="FNanchor54"></a><a href="#Footnote-54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>At the time when Wirt wrote this rhapsody, he
was unable, as he tells us, to procure from any
quarter a rational account of the line of argument
taken by Patrick Henry, or even of any other than
a single topic alluded to by him in the course of
his speech,&mdash;they who heard the speech saying
&#8220;that when it was over, they felt as if they had
just awaked from some ecstatic dream, of which
they were unable to recall or connect the
particulars.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor55" id="FNanchor55"></a><a href="#Footnote-55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
</p>

<p>There was present in that assemblage, however,
at least one person who listened to the young orator
without falling into an ecstatic dream, and whose
senses were so well preserved to him through it all
that he was able, a few days afterward, while the
whole occasion was fresh in his memory, to place
upon record a clear and connected version of the
wonder-working speech. This version is to be
found in a letter written by the plaintiff on the
12th of December, 1763, and has been brought to
light only within recent years.</p>

<p>After giving, for the benefit of the learned
counsel by whom the cause was to be managed, on
appeal, in the general court, a lucid and rather
critical account of the whole proceeding, Maury
adds:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;One occurrence more, though not essential to the
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
cause, I can&#8217;t help mentioning.&hellip; Mr. Henry, mentioned
above (who had been called in by the defendants,
as we suspected, to do what I some time ago told you
of), after Mr. Lyons had opened the cause, rose and
harangued the jury for near an hour. This harangue
turned upon points as much out of his own depth, and
that of the jury, as they were foreign from the purpose,&mdash;which
it would be impertinent to mention here.
However, after he had discussed those points, he labored
to prove &#8216;that the Act of 1758 had every characteristic
of a good law; that it was a law of general utility,
and could not, consistently with what he called the
original compact between the king and people &hellip; be
annulled.&#8217; Hence he inferred, &#8216;that a king, by disallowing
acts of this salutary nature, from being the father
of his people, degenerated into a tyrant, and forfeits
all right to his subjects&#8217; obedience.&#8217; He further urged
&#8216;that the only use of an established church and clergy
in society, is to enforce obedience to civil sanctions, and
the observance of those which are called duties of imperfect
obligation; that when a clergy ceases to answer
these ends, the community have no further need of their
ministry, and may justly strip them of their appointments;
that the clergy of Virginia, in this particular
instance of their refusing to acquiesce in the law in question,
had been so far from answering, that they had
most notoriously counteracted, those great ends of their
institution; that, therefore, instead of useful members
of the state, they ought to be considered as enemies of
the community; and that, in the case now before them,
Mr. Maury, instead of countenance, and protection, and
damages, very justly deserved to be punished with signal
severity.&#8217; And then he perorates to the following
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
purpose, &#8216;that excepting they (the jury) were disposed
to rivet the chains of bondage on their own necks, he
hoped they would not let slip the opportunity which
now offered, of making such an example of him as
might, hereafter, be a warning to himself and his brethren,
not to have the temerity, for the future, to dispute
the validity of such laws, authenticated by the only authority
which, in his conception, could give force to laws
for the government of this colony,&mdash;the authority of a
legal representative of a council, and of a kind and benevolent
and patriot governor.&#8217; You&#8217;ll observe I do
not pretend to remember his words, but take this to
have been the sum and substance of this part of his
labored oration. When he came to that part of it where
he undertook to assert &#8216;that a king, by annulling or disallowing
acts of so salutary a nature, from being the
father of his people, degenerated into a tyrant, and forfeits
all right to his subjects&#8217; obedience,&#8217; the more sober
part of the audience were struck with horror. Mr.
Lyons called out aloud, and with an honest warmth, to
the Bench, &#8216;that the gentleman had spoken treason,&#8217;
and expressed his astonishment, &#8216;that their worships
could hear it without emotion, or any mark of dissatisfaction.&#8217;
At the same instant, too, amongst some gentlemen
in the crowd behind me, was a confused murmur
of &#8216;treason, treason!&#8217; Yet Mr. Henry went on in
the same treasonable and licentious strain, without interruption
from the Bench, nay, even without receiving the
least exterior notice of their disapprobation. One of
the jury, too, was so highly pleased with these doctrines,
that, as I was afterwards told, he every now and then
gave the traitorous declaimer a nod of approbation. After
the court was adjourned, he apologized to me for what he
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
had said, alleging that his sole view in engaging in the
cause, and in saying what he had, was to render himself
popular. You see, then, it is so clear a point in this
person&#8217;s opinion that the ready road to popularity here
is to trample under foot the interests of religion, the
rights of the church, and the prerogatives of the
crown.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor56" id="FNanchor56"></a><a href="#Footnote-56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>

the popularity of laws whose chief effects were to diminish the
pay of the established clergy, should be considered those connected
with a growing dissent from the established church in Virginia,
and particularly with the very human dislike which even
churchmen might have to paying in the form of a compulsory tax
what they would have cheerfully paid in the form of a voluntary
contribution. Perhaps the best modern defense of these laws is
by A. H. Everett, in his <i>Life of Henry</i>, 230-233; but his statements
seem to be founded on imperfect information. Wirt, publishing
his opinion under the responsibility of his great professional
and official position, affirms that on the whole question,

<h2>CHAPTER V <br />
<span class="hsub">FIRST TRIUMPHS AT THE CAPITAL</span></h2>


<p>It is not in the least strange that the noble-minded
clergyman, who was the plaintiff in the
famous cause of the Virginia parsons, should have
been deeply offended by the fierce and victorious
eloquence of the young advocate on the opposite
side, and should have let fall, with reference to
him, some bitter words. Yet it could only be in
a moment of anger that any one who knew him
could ever have said of Patrick Henry that he was
disposed &#8220;to trample under foot the interests of
religion,&#8221; or that he had any ill-will toward the
church or its ministers. It is very likely that, in
the many irritations growing out of a civil establishment
of the church in his native colony, he
may have shared in feelings that were not uncommon
even among devout churchmen there; but in
spite of this, then and always, to the very end of
his life, his most sacred convictions and his tenderest
affections seem to have been on the side of
the institutions and ministers of Christianity, and
even of Christianity in its historic form. Accordingly,
both before and after his great speech, he
tried to indicate to the good men whose
legal
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
claims it had become his professional duty to resist,
that such resistance must not be taken by them as
implying on his part any personal unkindness. To
his uncle and namesake, the Reverend Patrick
Henry, who was even then a plaintiff in a similar
suit, and whom he had affectionately persuaded
not to remain at the courthouse to hear the coming
speech against the pecuniary demands of himself
and his order, he said &#8220;that the clergy had
not thought him worthy of being retained on their
side,&#8221; and that &#8220;he knew of no moral principle
by which he was bound to refuse a fee from their
adversaries.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor57" id="FNanchor57"></a><a href="#Footnote-57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
So, too, the conciliatory words,
which, after the trial, he tried to speak to the indignant
plaintiff, and which the latter has reported
in the blunt form corresponding to his own angry
interpretation of them, after all may have borne
the better meaning given to them by Bishop Meade,
who says that Patrick Henry, in his apology to
Maury, &#8220;pleaded as an excuse for his course, that
he was a young lawyer, a candidate for practice
and reputation, and therefore must make the best
of his cause.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor58" id="FNanchor58"></a><a href="#Footnote-58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
</p>

<p>These genial efforts at pacification are of rather
more than casual significance: they are indications
of character. They mark a distinct quality of the
man&#8217;s nature, of which he continued to give evidence
during the rest of his life,&mdash;a certain sweetness
of spirit, which never deserted him through
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
all the stern conflicts of his career. He was always
a good fighter: never a good hater. He had
the brain and the temperament of an advocate;
his imagination and his heart always kindled hotly
to the side that he had espoused, and with his imagination
and his heart always went all the rest of
the man; in his advocacy of any cause that he had
thus made his own, he hesitated at no weapon
either of offence or of defence; he struck hard
blows&mdash;he spoke hard words&mdash;and he usually
triumphed; and yet, even in the paroxysms of the
combat, and still more so when the combat was
over, he showed how possible it is to be a redoubtable
antagonist without having a particle of
malice.</p>

<p>Then, too, from this first great scene in his public
life, there comes down to us another incident
that has its own story to tell. In all the roar of
talk within and about the courthouse, after the
trial was over, one &#8220;Mr. Cootes, merchant of
James River,&#8221; was heard to say that &#8220;he would
have given a considerable sum out of his own
pocket rather than his friend Patrick should have
been guilty of a crime but little, if any thing, inferior
to that which brought Simon Lord Lovat to
the block,&#8221;&mdash;adding that Patrick&#8217;s speech had
&#8220;exceeded the most seditious and inflammatory
harangues of the Tribunes of Old
Rome.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor59" id="FNanchor59"></a><a href="#Footnote-59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
Here,
then, thus early in his career, even in this sorrowful
and alarmed criticism on the supposed error of
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
his speech, we find a token of that loving interest
in him and in his personal fate, which even in
those days began to possess the heartstrings of
many a Virginian all about the land, and which
thenceforward steadily broadened and deepened
into a sort of popular idolization of him. The
mysterious hold which Patrick Henry came to have
upon the people of Virginia is an historic fact, to
be recognized, even if not accounted for. He was
to make enemies in abundance, as will appear; he
was to stir up against himself the alarm of many
thoughtful and conservative minds, the deadly
hatred of many an old leader in colonial politics,
the deadly envy of many a younger aspirant to
public influence; he was to go on ruffling the
plumage and upsetting the combinations of all
sorts of good citizens, who, from time to time, in
making their reckonings without him, kept finding
that they had reckoned without their host. But
for all that, the willingness of this worthy Mr.
Cootes of James River to part with his money, if
need be, rather than his friend Patrick should go
far wrong, seems to be one token of the beginning
of that deep and swelling passion of love for him
that never abated among the mass of the people of
Virginia so long as Patrick lived, and perhaps has
never abated since.</p>

<p>It is not hard to imagine the impulse which so
astonishing a forensic success must have given to
the professional and political career of the young
advocate. Not only was he immediately retained
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
by the defendants in all the other suits of the same
kind then instituted in the courts of the colony,
but, as his fee-books show, from that hour his legal
practice of every sort received an enormous increase.
Moreover, the people of Virginia, always
a warm-hearted people, were then, to a degree
almost inconceivable at the North, sensitive to
oratory, and admirers of eloquent men. The first
test by which they commonly ascertained the fitness
of a man for public office, concerned his ability
to make a speech; and it cannot be doubted
that from the moment of Patrick Henry&#8217;s amazing
harangue in the &#8220;Parsons&#8217; Cause,&#8221;&mdash;a piece of
oratory altogether surpassing anything ever before
heard in Virginia,&mdash;the eyes of men began to
fasten upon him as destined to some splendid and
great part in political life.</p>

<p>During the earlier years of his career, Williamsburg
was the capital of the colony,&mdash;the official
residence of its governor, the place of assemblage
for its legislature and its highest courts, and, at
certain seasons of the year, the scene of no little
vice-regal and provincial magnificence.</p>

<p>Thither our Patrick had gone in 1760 to get
permission to be a lawyer. Thither he now goes
once more, in 1764, to give some proof of his quality
in the profession to which he had been reluctantly
admitted, and to win for himself the first of
a long series of triumphs at the colonial capital,&mdash;triumphs
which gave food for wondering talk
to all his contemporaries, and long lingered in the
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
memories of old men. Soon after the assembling
of the legislature, in the fall of 1764, the committee
on privileges and elections had before them the
case of James Littlepage, who had taken his seat
as member for the county of Hanover, but whose
right to the seat was contested, on a charge of
bribery and corruption, by Nathaniel West Dandridge.
For a day or two before the hearing of
the case, the members of the house had &#8220;observed
an ill-dressed young man sauntering in the lobby,&#8221;
apparently a stranger to everybody, moving &#8220;awkwardly
about &hellip; with a countenance of abstraction
and total unconcern as to what was passing
around him;&#8221; but who, when the committee convened
to consider the case of Dandridge against
Littlepage, at once took his place as counsel for
the former. The members of the committee, either
not catching his name or not recalling the association
attaching to it from the scene at Hanover
Court House nearly a twelvemonth before, were
so affected by his rustic and ungainly appearance
that they treated him with neglect and even with
discourtesy; until, when his turn came to argue
the cause of his client, he poured forth such a torrent
of eloquence, and exhibited with so much
force and splendor the sacredness of the suffrage
and the importance of protecting it, that the incivility
and contempt of the committee were turned
into admiration.<a name="FNanchor60" id="FNanchor60"></a><a href="#Footnote-60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
Nevertheless, it appears from
the journals of the House that, whatever may have
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
been the admiration of the committee for the eloquence
of Mr. Dandridge&#8217;s advocate, they did not
award the seat to Mr. Dandridge.</p>

<p>Such was Patrick Henry&#8217;s first contact with the
legislature of Virginia,&mdash;a body of which he was
soon to become a member, and over which, in
spite of the social prestige, the talents, and the
envious opposition of its old leaders, he was
promptly to gain an ascendancy that constituted
him, almost literally, the dictator of its proceedings,
so long as he chose to hold a place in it. On
the present occasion, having finished the somewhat
obscure business that had brought him before the
committee, it is probable that he instantly disappeared
from the scene, not to return to it until the
following spring, when he came back to transact
business with the House itself. For, early in
May, 1765, a vacancy having occurred in the representation
for the county of Louisa, Patrick
Henry, though not then a resident in that county,
was elected as its member. The first entry to be
met with in the journals, indicating his presence
in the House, is that of his appointment, on the
20th of May, as an additional member of the committee
for courts of justice. Between that date
and the 1st of June, when the House was angrily
dissolved by the governor, this young and very
rural member contrived to do two or three quite
notable things&mdash;things, in fact, so notable that
they conveyed to the people of Virginia the tidings
of the advent among them of a great political
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
leader, gave an historic impulse to the series of
measures which ended in the disruption of the
British Empire, and set his own name a ringing
through the world,&mdash;not without lively imputations
of treason, and comforting assurances that he
was destined to be hanged.</p>

<p>The first of these notable things is one which
incidentally throws a rather painful glare on the
corruptions of political life in our old and belauded
colonial days. The speaker of the House of Burgesses
at that time was John Robinson, a man of
great estate, foremost among all the landed aristocracy
of Virginia. He had then been speaker for
about twenty-five years; for a long time, also, he
had been treasurer of the colony; and in the latter
capacity he had been accustomed for many years
to lend the public money, on his own private account,
to his personal and political friends, and
particularly to those of them who were members
of the House. This profligate business had continued
so long that Robinson had finally become a
defaulter to an enormous amount; and in order
to avert the shame and ruin of an exposure, he
and his particular friends, just before the arrival
of Patrick Henry, had invented a very pretty device,
to be called a &#8220;public loan office,&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;from
which monies might be lent on public account, and
on good landed security, to individuals,&#8221; and by
which, as was expected, the debts due to Robinson
on the loans which he had been granting might be
&#8220;transferred to the public, and his deficit thus
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
completely
covered.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor61" id="FNanchor61"></a><a href="#Footnote-61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
Accordingly, the scheme
was brought forward under nearly every possible
advantage of influential support. It was presented
to the House and to the public as a measure eminently
wise and beneficial. It was supported in
the House by many powerful and honorable members
who had not the remotest suspicion of the
corrupt purpose lying at the bottom of it. Apparently
it was on the point of adoption when, from
among the members belonging to the upper counties,
there arose this raw youth, who had only just
taken his seat, and who, without any information
respecting the secret intent of the measure, and
equally without any disposition to let the older
and statelier members do his thinking for him,
simply attacked it, as a scheme to be condemned
on general principles. From the door of the lobby
that day there stood peering into the Assembly
Thomas Jefferson, then a law student at Williamsburg,
who thus had the good luck to witness the
d&eacute;but of his old comrade. &#8220;He laid open with so
much energy the spirit of favoritism on which the
proposition was founded, and the abuses to which
it would lead, that it was crushed in its
birth.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor62" id="FNanchor62"></a><a href="#Footnote-62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
He &#8220;attacked the scheme &hellip; in that style of
bold, grand, and overwhelming eloquence for which
he became so justly celebrated afterwards. He
carried with him all the members of the upper
counties, and left a minority composed merely of
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
the aristocracy of the country. From this time
his popularity swelled apace; and Robinson dying
four years after, his deficit was brought to light,
and discovered the true object of the
proposition.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor63" id="FNanchor63"></a><a href="#Footnote-63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
</p>

<p>But a subject far greater than John Robinson&#8217;s
project for a loan office was then beginning to
weigh on men&#8217;s minds. Already were visible far
off on the edge of the sky, the first filmy threads
of a storm-cloud that was to grow big and angry
as the years went by, and was to accompany a
political tempest under which the British Empire
would be torn asunder, and the whole structure of
American colonial society wrenched from its foundations.
Just one year before the time now reached,
news had been received in Virginia that the British
ministry had announced in parliament their purpose
to introduce, at the next session, an act for
laying certain stamp duties on the American colonies.
Accordingly, in response to these tidings,
the House of Burgesses, in the autumn of 1764,
had taken the earliest opportunity to send a respectful
message to the government of England,
declaring that the proposed act would be deemed
by the loyal and affectionate people of Virginia as
an alarming violation of their ancient constitutional
rights. This message had been elaborately drawn
up, in the form of an address to the king, a memorial
to the House of Lords, and a remonstrance to
the Commons;<a name="FNanchor64" id="FNanchor64"></a><a href="#Footnote-64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
the writers being a committee composed
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
of gentlemen prominent in the legislature,
and of high social standing in the colony, including
Landon Carter, Richard Henry Lee, George
Wythe, Edmund Pendleton, Benjamin Harrison,
Richard Bland, and even Peyton Randolph, the
king&#8217;s attorney-general.</p>

<p>Meantime, to this appeal no direct answer had
been returned; instead of which, however, was
received by the House of Burgesses, in May, 1765,
about the time of Patrick Henry&#8217;s accession to
that body, a copy of the Stamp Act itself. What
was to be done about it? What was to be done
by Virginia? What was to be done by her sister
colonies? Of course, by the passage of the Stamp
Act, the whole question of colonial procedure on
the subject had been changed. While the act
was, even in England, merely a theme for consideration,
and while the colonies were virtually under
invitation to send thither their views upon the
subject, it was perfectly proper for colonial pamphleteers
and for colonial legislatures to express, in
every civilized form, their objections to it. But
all this was now over. The Stamp Act had been
discussed; the discussion was ended; the act had
been decided on; it had become a law. Criticism
upon it now, especially by a legislative body, was
a very different matter from what criticism upon
it had been, even by the same body, a few months
before. Then, the loyal legislature of Virginia
had fittingly spoken out, concerning the contemplated
act, its manly words of disapproval and of
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
protest; but now that the contemplated act had
become an adopted act&mdash;had become the law of
the land&mdash;could that same legislature again speak
even those same words, without thereby becoming
disloyal,&mdash;without venturing a little too near the
verge of sedition,&mdash;without putting itself into an
attitude, at least, of incipient nullification respecting
a law of the general government?</p>

<p>It is perfectly evident that by all the old leaders
of the House at that moment,&mdash;by Peyton Randolph,
and Pendleton, and Wythe, and Bland,
and the rest of them,&mdash;this question was answered
in the negative. Indeed, it could be answered in
no other way. Such being the case, it followed
that, for Virginia and for all her sister colonies,
an entirely new state of things had arisen. A
most serious problem confronted them,&mdash;a problem
involving, in fact, incalculable interests. On
the subject of immediate concern, they had endeavored,
freely and rightfully, to influence legislation,
while that legislation was in process; but
now that this legislation was accomplished, what
were they to do? Were they to submit to it quietly,
trusting to further negotiations for ultimate
relief, or were they to reject it outright, and try
to obstruct its execution? Clearly, here was a
very great problem, a problem for statesmanship,&mdash;the
best statesmanship anywhere to be had.
Clearly this was a time, at any rate, for wise and
experienced men to come to the front; a time, not
for rash counsels, nor for spasmodic and isolated
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
action on the part of any one colony, but for deliberate
and united action on the part of all the colonies;
a time in which all must move forward, or
none. But, thus far, no colony had been heard
from: there had not been time. Let Virginia
wait a little. Let her make no mistake; let her
not push forward into any ill-considered and dangerous
measure; let her wait, at least, for some
signal of thought or of purpose from her sister
colonies. In the meanwhile, let her old and tried
leaders continue to lead.</p>

<p>Such, apparently, was the state of opinion in
the House of Burgesses when, on the 29th of May,
a motion was made and carried, &#8220;that the House
resolve itself into a committee of the whole House,
immediately to consider the steps necessary to be
taken in consequence of the resolutions of the
House of Commons of Great Britain, relative to
the charging certain stamp duties in the colonies
and plantations in
America.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor65" id="FNanchor65"></a><a href="#Footnote-65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
On thus going
into committee of the whole, to deliberate on the
most difficult and appalling question that, up to
that time, had ever come before an American legislature,
the members may very naturally have turned
in expectation to those veteran politicians and to
those able constitutional lawyers who, for many
years, had been accustomed to guide their deliberations,
and who, especially in the last session, had
taken charge of this very question of the Stamp
Act. It will not be hard for us to imagine the
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
disgust, the anger, possibly even the alarm, with
which many may have beheld the floor now taken,
not by Peyton Randolph, nor Richard Bland, nor
George Wythe, nor Edmund Pendleton, but by
this new and very unabashed member for the
county of Louisa,&mdash;this rustic and clownish youth
of the terrible tongue,&mdash;this eloquent but presumptuous
stripling, who was absolutely without
training or experience in statesmanship, and was
the merest novice even in the forms of the House.</p>

<p>For what precise purpose the new member had
thus ventured to take the floor, was known at the
moment of his rising by only two other members,&mdash;George
Johnston, the member for Fairfax, and
John Fleming, the member for Cumberland. But
the measureless audacity of his purpose, as being
nothing less than that of assuming the leadership
of the House, and of dictating the policy of Virginia
in this stupendous crisis of its fate, was instantly
revealed to all, as he moved a series of
resolutions, which he proceeded to read from the
blank leaf of an old law book, and which, probably,
were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;<i>Whereas</i>, the honorable House of Commons in England
have of late drawn into question how far the General
Assembly of this colony hath power to enact laws for
laying of taxes and imposing duties, payable by the people
of this, his majesty&#8217;s most ancient colony: for settling
and ascertaining the same to all future times, the House
of Burgesses of this present General Assembly have
come to the following resolves:&mdash;
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;1. <i>Resolved</i>, That the first adventurers and settlers
of this, his majesty&#8217;s colony and dominion, brought with
them and transmitted to their posterity, and all other
his majesty&#8217;s subjects, since inhabiting in this, his majesty&#8217;s
said colony, all the privileges, franchises, and
immunities that have at any time been held, enjoyed,
and possessed, by the people of Great Britain.</p>

<p>&#8220;2. <i>Resolved</i>, That by two royal charters, granted
by king James the First, the colonists aforesaid are declared
entitled to all the privileges, liberties, and immunities
of denizens and natural born subjects, to all
intents and purposes, as if they had been abiding and
born within the realm of England.</p>

<p>&#8220;3. <i>Resolved</i>, That the taxation of the people by
themselves or by persons chosen by themselves to represent
them, who can only know what taxes the people
are able to bear, and the easiest mode of raising them,
and are equally affected by such taxes themselves, is the
distinguishing characteristic of British freedom, and
without which the ancient constitution cannot subsist.</p>

<p>&#8220;4. <i>Resolved</i>, That his majesty&#8217;s liege people of this
most ancient colony have uninterruptedly enjoyed the
right of being thus governed by their own Assembly in
the article of their taxes and internal police, and that
the same hath never been forfeited, or any other way
given up, but hath been constantly recognized by the
kings and people of Great Britain.</p>

<p>&#8220;5. <i>Resolved</i>, therefore, That the General Assembly
of this colony have the only and sole exclusive right and
power to lay taxes and impositions upon the inhabitants
of this colony; and that every attempt to vest such
power in any person or persons whatsoever, other than
the General Assembly aforesaid, has a manifest tendency
to destroy British as well as American
freedom.<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
</p>

<p>&#8220;6. <i>Resolved</i>, That his majesty&#8217;s liege people, the
inhabitants of this colony, are not bound to yield obedience
to any law or ordinance whatever, designed to impose
any taxation whatsoever upon them, other than the
laws or ordinances of the General Assembly aforesaid.</p>

<p>&#8220;7. <i>Resolved</i>, That any person who shall, by speaking
or writing, assert or maintain that any person or
persons, other than the General Assembly of this colony,
have any right or power to impose or lay any taxation
on the people here, shall be deemed an enemy to his
majesty&#8217;s
colony.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor66" id="FNanchor66"></a><a href="#Footnote-66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>No reader will find it hard to accept Jefferson&#8217;s
statement that the debate on these resolutions was
&#8220;most bloody.&#8221; &#8220;They were opposed by Randolph,
Bland, Pendleton, Nicholas, Wythe, and
all the old members, whose influence in the House
had till then been
unbroken.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor67" id="FNanchor67"></a><a href="#Footnote-67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
There was every
reason, whether of public policy or of private feeling,
why the old party leaders in the House should
now bestir themselves, and combine, and put forth
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
all their powers in debate, to check, and if possible
to rout and extinguish, this self-conceited but most
dangerous young man. &#8220;Many threats were uttered,
and much abuse cast on me,&#8221; said Patrick
himself, long afterward. Logic, learning, eloquence,
denunciation, derision, intimidation, were
poured from all sides of the House upon the head
of the presumptuous intruder; but alone, or almost
alone, he confronted and defeated all his assailants.
&#8220;Torrents of sublime eloquence from Mr.
Henry, backed by the solid reasoning of Johnston,
prevailed.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor68" id="FNanchor68"></a><a href="#Footnote-68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
</p>

<p>It was sometime in the course of this tremendous
fight, extending through the 29th and 30th of
May, that the incident occurred which has long
been familiar among the anecdotes of the Revolution,
and which may be here recalled as a reminiscence
not only of his own consummate mastery of
the situation, but of a most dramatic scene in an
epoch-making debate. Reaching the climax of a
passage of fearful invective, on the injustice and
the impolicy of the Stamp Act, he said in tones
of thrilling solemnity, &#8220;C&aelig;sar had his Brutus;
Charles the First, his Cromwell; and George the
Third [&#8216;Treason,&#8217; shouted the speaker. &#8216;Treason,&#8217;
&#8216;treason,&#8217; rose from all sides of the room.
The orator paused in stately defiance till these
rude exclamations were ended, and then, rearing
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
himself with a look and bearing of still prouder
and fiercer determination, he so closed the sentence
as to baffle his accusers, without in the least flinching
from his own position,]&mdash;and George the
Third may profit by their example. If this be
treason, make the most of
it.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor69" id="FNanchor69"></a><a href="#Footnote-69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
</p>

<p>Of this memorable struggle nearly all other
details have perished with the men who took part
in it. After the House, in committee of the
whole, had, on the 29th of May, spent sufficient
time in the discussion, &#8220;Mr. Speaker resumed the
chair,&#8221; says the Journal, &#8220;and Mr. Attorney reported
that the said committee had had the said
matter under consideration, and had come to several
resolutions thereon, which he was ready to
deliver in at the table. Ordered that the said report
be received to-morrow.&#8221; It is probable that
on the morrow the battle was renewed with even
greater fierceness than before. The Journal proceeds:
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
&#8220;May 30. Mr. Attorney, from the committee
of the whole House, reported according to
order, that the committee had considered the steps
necessary to be taken in consequence of the resolutions
of the House of Commons of Great Britain,
relative to the charging certain stamp duties in
the colonies and plantations in America, and that
they had come to several resolutions thereon, which
he read in his place and then delivered at the
table; when they were again twice read, and agreed
to by the House, with some amendments.&#8221; Then
were passed by the House, probably, the first five
resolutions as offered by Henry in the committee,
but &#8220;passed,&#8221; as he himself afterward wrote, &#8220;by
a very small majority, perhaps of one or two only.&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon this final discomfiture of the old leaders,
one of their number, Peyton Randolph, swept
angrily out of the house, and brushing past young
Thomas Jefferson, who was standing in the door
of the lobby, he swore, with a great oath, that he
&#8220;would have given five hundred guineas for a single
vote.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor70" id="FNanchor70"></a><a href="#Footnote-70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
On the afternoon of that day, Patrick
Henry, knowing that the session was practically
ended, and that his own work in it was done,
started for his home. He was seen &#8220;passing along
Duke of Gloucester Street, &hellip; wearing buckskin
breeches, his saddle bags on his arm, leading
a lean horse, and chatting with Paul Carrington,
who walked by his
side.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor71" id="FNanchor71"></a><a href="#Footnote-71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>



<p><span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>That was on the 30th of May. The next morning,
the terrible Patrick being at last quite out of
the way, those veteran lawyers and politicians of
the House, who had found this young protagonist
alone too much for them all put together, made
bold to undo the worst part of the work he had
done the day before; they expunged the fifth resolution.
In that mutilated form, without the preamble,
and with the last three of the original resolutions
omitted, the first four then remained on
the journal of the House as the final expression of
its official opinion. Meantime, on the wings of
the wind, and on the eager tongues of men, had
been borne, past recall, far northward and far
southward, the fiery unchastised words of nearly
the entire series, to kindle in all the colonies a
great flame of dauntless
purpose;<a name="FNanchor72" id="FNanchor72"></a><a href="#Footnote-72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
while Patrick
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
himself, perhaps then only half conscious of the
fateful work he had just been doing, travelled
homeward along the dusty highway, at once the
jolliest, the most popular, and the least pretentious
man in all Virginia, certainly its greatest orator,
possibly even its greatest statesman.</p>

course, the more effective and characteristic; and as Tyler actually
heard the speech, and as, moreover, his account is confirmed

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-72" id="Footnote-72"></a><a href="#FNanchor72"><span class="label">[72]</span></a> The subject of the Virginia resolutions presents several difficulties
which I have not thought it best to discuss in the text,
where I have given merely the results of my own rather careful
and repeated study of the question. In brief, my conclusion is
this: That the series as given above, consisting of a preamble and
seven resolutions, is the series as originally prepared by Patrick
Henry, and introduced by him on Wednesday, May 29, in the committee
of the whole, and probably passed by the committee on that
day; that at once, without waiting for the action of the House
upon the subject, copies of the series got abroad, and were soon
published in the newspapers of the several colonies, as though actually
adopted by the House; that on Thursday, May 30, the series
was cut down in the House by rejection of the preamble and the
resolutions 6 and 7, and by the adoption of only the first five as
given above; that on the day after that, when Patrick Henry had
gone home, the House still further cut down the series by expunging
the resolution which is above numbered as 5: and that, many
years afterwards, when Patrick Henry came to prepare a copy for
transmission to posterity, he gave the resolutions just as they stood
when adopted by the House on May 30, and not as they stood
when originally introduced by him in committee of the whole on
the day before, nor as they stood when mutilated by the cowardly
act of the House on the day after. It will be noticed, therefore,
that the so-called resolutions of Virginia, which were actually
published and known to the colonies in 1765, and which did so
much to fire their hearts, were not the resolutions as adopted by
the House, but were the resolutions as first introduced, and probably
passed, in committee of the whole; and that even this copy of
them was inaccurately given, since it lacked the resolution numbered
above as 3, probably owing to an error in the first hurried
transcription of them. Those who care to study the subject further
will find the materials in <i>Prior Documents</i>, 6, 7; Marshall,
<i>Life of Washington</i>, i. note iv.; Frothingham, <i>Rise of the Republic</i>,
180 note; Gordon, <i>Hist. Am. Rev.</i>, i. 129-139; <i>Works of Jefferson</i>,
vi. 366, 367; Wirt, <i>Life of Henry</i>, 56-63; Everett, <i>Life
of Henry</i>, 265-273, with important note by Jared Sparks in Appendix,
391-398. It may be mentioned that the narrative given
in Burk, <i>Hist. Va.</i>, iii. 305-310, is untrustworthy.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VI <br />
<span class="hsub">CONSEQUENCES</span></h2>


<p>Seldom has a celebrated man shown more indifference
to the preservation of the records and
credentials of his career than did Patrick Henry.
While some of his famous associates in the Revolution
diligently kept both the letters they received,
and copies of the letters they wrote, and made, for
the benefit of posterity, careful memoranda concerning
the events of their lives, Patrick Henry
did none of these things. Whatever letters he
wrote, he wrote at a dash, and then parted with
them utterly; whatever letters were written to
him, were invariably handed over by him to the
comfortable custody of luck; and as to the correct
historic perpetuation of his doings, he seems almost
to have exhausted his interest in each one of
them so soon as he had accomplished it, and to
have been quite content to leave to other people
all responsibility for its being remembered correctly,
or even remembered at all.</p>

<p>To this statement, however, a single exception
has to be made. It relates to the great affair described
in the latter part of the previous chapter.</p>

<p>Of course, it was perceived at the time that
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the passing of the Virginia resolutions against the
Stamp Act was a great affair; but just how great
an affair it was, neither Patrick Henry nor any
other mortal man could tell until years had gone
by, and had unfolded the vast sequence of world-resounding
events, in which that affair was proved
to be a necessary factor. It deserves to be particularly
mentioned that, of all the achievements
of his life, the only one which he has taken the
pains to give any account of is his authorship of
the Virginia resolutions, and his successful championship
of them. With reference to this achievement,
the account he gave of it was rendered with
so much solemnity and impressiveness as to indicate
that, in the final survey of his career, he regarded
this as the one most important thing he
ever did. But before we cite the words in which
he thus indicated this judgment, it will be well for
us to glance briefly at the train of historic incidents
which now set forth the striking connection between
that act of Patrick Henry and the early
development of that intrepid policy which culminated
in American independence.</p>

<p>It was on the 29th of May, 1765, as will be remembered,
that Patrick Henry moved in the committee
of the whole the adoption of his series of
resolutions against the Stamp Act; and before the
sun went down that day, the entire series, as is
probable, was adopted by the committee. On the
following day, the essential portion of the series
was adopted, likewise, by the House. But what
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
was the contemporary significance of these resolutions?
As the news of them swept from colony
to colony, why did they so stir men&#8217;s hearts to
excitement, and even to alarm? It was not that
the language of those resolutions was more radical
or more trenchant than had been the language
already used on the same subject, over and over
again, in the discussions of the preceding twelve
months. It was that, in the recent change of the
political situation, the significance of that language
had changed. Prior to the time referred to, whatever
had been said on the subject, in any of the
colonies, had been said for the purpose of dissuading
the government from passing the Stamp Act.
But the government had now passed the Stamp
Act; and, accordingly, these resolutions must have
been meant for a very different purpose. They
were a virtual declaration of resistance to the
Stamp Act; a declaration of resistance made, not
by an individual writer, nor by a newspaper, but
by the legislature of a great colony; and, moreover,
they were the very first declaration of resistance
which was so
made.<a name="FNanchor73" id="FNanchor73"></a><a href="#Footnote-73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
</p>

<p>This it is which gives us the contemporary key
to their significance, and to the vast excitement
produced by them, and to the enormous influence
they had upon the trembling purposes of the colonists
at that precise moment. Hence it was, as
a sagacious writer of that period has told us, that
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
merely upon the adoption of these resolves by the
committee of the whole, men recognized their momentous
bearing, and could not be restrained from
giving publicity to them, without waiting for their
final adoption by the House. &#8220;A manuscript of
the unrevised resolves,&#8221; says William Gordon,
&#8220;soon reached Philadelphia, having been sent off
immediately upon their passing, that the earliest
information of what had been done might be obtained
by the Sons of Liberty.&hellip; At New
York the resolves were handed about with great
privacy: they were accounted so treasonable, that
the possessors of them declined printing them in
that city.&#8221; But a copy of them having been procured
with much difficulty by an Irish gentleman
resident in Connecticut, &#8220;he carried them to New
England, where they were published and circulated
far and wide in the newspapers, without any reserve,
and proved eventually the occasion of those
disorders which afterward broke out in the colonies.&hellip;
The Virginia resolutions gave a spring
to all the disgusted; and they began to adopt different
measures.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor74" id="FNanchor74"></a><a href="#Footnote-74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>But while the tidings of these resolutions were
thus moving toward New England, and before they
had arrived there, the assembly of the great colony
of Massachusetts had begun to take action. Indeed,
it had first met on the very day on which
Patrick Henry had introduced his resolutions into
the committee of the whole at Williamsburg. On
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
the 8th of June, it had resolved upon a circular
letter concerning the Stamp Act, addressed to all
the sister colonies, and proposing that all should
send delegates to a congress to be held at New
York, on the first Tuesday of the following October,
to deal with the perils and duties of the situation.
This circular letter at once started upon its
tour.</p>

<p>The first reception of it, however, was discouraging.
From the speaker of the New Jersey assembly
came the reply that the members of that
body were &#8220;unanimously against uniting on the
present occasion;&#8221; and for several weeks thereafter,
&#8220;no movement appeared in favor of the
great and wise measure of convening a congress.&#8221;
At last, however, the project of Massachusetts
began to feel the accelerating force of a mighty
impetus. The Virginia resolutions, being at last
divulged throughout the land, &#8220;had a marked effect
on public opinion.&#8221; They were &#8220;heralded as the
voice of a colony.&hellip; The fame of the resolves
spread as they were circulated in the journals.&hellip;
The Virginia action, like an alarum, roused
the patriots to pass similar
resolves.<a name="FNanchor75" id="FNanchor75"></a><a href="#Footnote-75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
&#8220;On the
8th of July, &#8220;The Boston Gazette&#8221; uttered this
most significant sentence: &#8220;The people of Virginia
have spoken very sensibly, and the frozen
politicians of a more northern government say they
have spoken
treason.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor76" id="FNanchor76"></a><a href="#Footnote-76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
On the same day, in that
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
same town of Boston, an aged lawyer and
patriot<a name="FNanchor77" id="FNanchor77"></a><a href="#Footnote-77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
lay upon his death bed; and in his admiration for
the Virginians on account of these resolves, he exclaimed,
&#8220;They are men; they are noble
spirits.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor78" id="FNanchor78"></a><a href="#Footnote-78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
On the 13th of August, the people of Providence
instructed their representatives in the legislature
to vote in favor of the congress, and to procure
the passage of a series of resolutions in which
were incorporated those of
Virginia.<a name="FNanchor79" id="FNanchor79"></a><a href="#Footnote-79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
On the 15th
of August, from Boston, Governor Bernard wrote
home to the ministry: &#8220;Two or three months ago,
I thought that this people would submit to the
Stamp Act. Murmurs were indeed continually
heard; but they seemed to be such as would die
away. But the publishing of the Virginia resolves
proved an alarm bell to the
disaffected.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor80" id="FNanchor80"></a><a href="#Footnote-80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
On the 23d of September, General Gage, the commander
of the British forces in America, wrote
from New York to Secretary Conway that the
Virginia resolves had given &#8220;the signal for a
general outcry over the
continent.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor81" id="FNanchor81"></a><a href="#Footnote-81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
And finally,
in the autumn of 1774, an able loyalist writer,
looking back over the political history of the colonies
from the year of the Stamp Act, singled out
the Virginia resolves as the baleful cause of all
the troubles that had then come upon the land.
&#8220;After it was known,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that the Stamp
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Act was passed, some resolves of the House of
Burgesses in Virginia, denying the right of Parliament
to tax the colonies, made their appearance.
We read them with wonder; they savored of independence;
they flattered the human passions; the
reasoning was specious; we wished it conclusive.
The transition to believing it so was easy; and we,
and almost all America, followed their example,
in resolving that Parliament had no such
right.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor82" id="FNanchor82"></a><a href="#Footnote-82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
</p>

<p>All these facts, and many more that might be
produced, seem to point to the Virginia resolutions
of 1765 as having come at a great primary crisis
of the Revolution,&mdash;a crisis of mental confusion
and hesitation,&mdash;and as having then uttered, with
trumpet voice, the very word that was fitted to the
hour, and that gave to men&#8217;s minds clearness of
vision, and to their hearts a settled purpose. It
must have been in the light of such facts as these
that Patrick Henry, in his old age, reviewing his
own wonderful career, determined to make a sort
of testamentary statement concerning his relation
to that single transaction,&mdash;so vitally connected
with the greatest epoch in American history.</p>

<p>Among the papers left by him at his death was
one significantly placed by the side of his will,
carefully sealed, and bearing this superscription:
&#8220;Inclosed are the resolutions of the Virginia Assembly
in 1765, concerning the Stamp Act. Let
my executors open this paper.&#8221; On opening the
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
document, his executors found on one side of the
sheet the first five resolutions in the famous series
introduced by him; and on the other side, these
weighty words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The within resolutions passed the House of Burgesses
in May, 1765. They formed the first opposition to the
Stamp Act, and the scheme of taxing America by the
British parliament. All the colonies, either through fear,
or want of opportunity to form an opposition, or from
influence of some kind or other, had remained silent. I
had been for the first time elected a Burgess a few days
before; was young, inexperienced, unacquainted with
the forms of the House, and the members that composed
it. Finding the men of weight averse to opposition, and
the commencement of the tax at hand, and that no person
was likely to step forth, I determined to venture;
and alone, unadvised, and unassisted, on a blank leaf of
an old law book, wrote the within.<a name="FNanchor83" id="FNanchor83"></a><a href="#Footnote-83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
Upon offering them
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
to the House, violent debates ensued. Many threats
were uttered, and much abuse cast on me by the party
for submission. After a long and warm contest, the resolutions
passed by a very small majority, perhaps of
one or two only. The alarm spread throughout America
with astonishing quickness, and the ministerial party
were overwhelmed. The great point of resistance to
British taxation was universally established in the colonies.
This brought on the war, which finally separated
the two countries, and gave independence to ours.</p>

<p>Whether this will prove a blessing or a curse, will depend
upon the use our people make of the blessings
which a gracious God hath bestowed on us. If they are
wise, they will be great and happy. If they are of a contrary
character, they will be miserable. Righteousness
alone can exalt them as a nation.</p>

<p>Reader! whoever thou art, remember this; and in
thy sphere practice virtue thyself, and encourage it in
others.</p>

<p class="right1"><span class="smcap">P. Henry.</span><a name="FNanchor84" id="FNanchor84"></a><a href="#Footnote-84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

</div>


<p>But while this renowned act in Patrick Henry&#8217;s
life had consequences so notable in their bearing
on great national and international movements, it
is interesting to observe, also, its immediate effects
on his own personal position in the world, and on
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the development of his career. We can hardly be
surprised to find, on the one hand, that his act
gave deep offence to one very considerable class of
persons in Virginia,&mdash;the official representatives
of the English government, and their natural allies,
those thoughtful and conscientious colonists
who, by temperament and conviction, were inclined
to lay a heavy accent on the principle of civil authority
and order. Of course, as the official head
of this not ignoble class, stood Francis Fauquier,
the lieutenant-governor of the colony; and his
letter to the lords of trade, written from Williamsburg
a few days after the close of the session,
contains a striking narrative of this stormy proceeding,
and an almost amusing touch of official
undervaluation of Patrick Henry: &#8220;In the course
of the debate, I have heard that very indecent language
was used by a Mr. Henry, a young lawyer,
who had not been above a month a member of the
House, and who carried all the young members
with him.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor85" id="FNanchor85"></a><a href="#Footnote-85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
But a far more specific and intense
expression of antipathy came, a few weeks later,
from the Reverend William Robinson, the colonial
commissary of the Bishop of London. Writing,
on the 12th of August, to his metropolitan, he
gave an account of Patrick Henry&#8217;s very offensive
management of the cause against the parsons, before
becoming a member of the House of Burgesses;
and then added:&mdash;<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;He has since been chosen a representative for one of
the counties, in which character he has lately distinguished
himself in the House of Burgesses on occasion of the arrival
of an act of Parliament for stamp duties, while the
Assembly was sitting. He blazed out in a violent speech
against the authority of Parliament and the king, comparing
his majesty to a Tarquin, a C&aelig;sar, and a Charles the
First, and not sparing insinuations that he wished another
Cromwell would arise. He made a motion for several
outrageous resolves, some of which passed and were
again erased as soon as his back was turned.&hellip; Mr.
Henry, the hero of whom I have been writing, is gone
quietly into the upper parts of the country to recommend
himself to his constituents by spreading treason and enforcing
firm resolutions against the authority of the British
Parliament.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor86" id="FNanchor86"></a><a href="#Footnote-86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Such was Patrick Henry&#8217;s introduction to the
upper spheres of English society,&mdash;spheres in
which his name was to become still better known
as time rolled on, and for conduct not likely to
efface the impression of this bitter beginning.</p>

<p>As to his reputation in the colonies outside of
Virginia, doubtless the progress of it, during this
period, was slow and dim; for the celebrity acquired
by the resolutions of 1765 attached to the
colony rather than to the person. Moreover, the
boundaries of each colony, in those days, were in
most cases the boundaries likewise of the personal
reputations it cherished. It was not until Patrick
Henry came forward, in the Congress of 1774,<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
upon an arena that may be called national, that his
name gathered about it the splendor of a national
fame. Yet, even before 1774, in the rather dull
and ungossiping newspapers of that time, and in
the letters and diaries of its public men, may be
discovered an occasional allusion showing that already
his name had broken over the borders of
Virginia, had traveled even so far as to New England,
and that in Boston itself he was a person
whom people were beginning to talk about. For
example, in his Diary for the 22d of July, 1770,
John Adams speaks of meeting some gentlemen
from Virginia, and of going out to Cambridge
with them. One of them is mentioned by name
as having this distinction,&mdash;that he &#8220;is an intimate
friend of Mr. Patrick Henry, the first mover
of the Virginia resolves in 1765.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor87" id="FNanchor87"></a><a href="#Footnote-87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
 Thus, even
so early, the incipient revolutionist in New England
had got his thoughts on his brilliant political
kinsman in Virginia.</p>

<p>But it was chiefly within the limits of his own
splendid and gallant colony, and among an eager
and impressionable people whose habitual hatred
of all restraints turned into undying love for this
dashing champion of natural liberty, that Patrick
Henry was now instantly crowned with his crown
of sovereignty. By his resolutions against the
Stamp Act, as Jefferson testifies, &#8220;Mr. Henry
took the lead out of the hands of those who had
heretofore guided the proceedings of the House,<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
that is to say, of Pendleton, Wythe, Bland, Randolph,
and Nicholas.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor88" id="FNanchor88"></a><a href="#Footnote-88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Wirt does not put the
case too strongly when he declares, that &#8220;after this
debate there was no longer a question among the
body of the people, as to Mr. Henry&#8217;s being the
first statesman and orator in Virginia. Those,
indeed, whose ranks he had scattered, and whom
he had thrown into the shade, still tried to brand
him with the names of declaimer and demagogue.
But this was obviously the effect of envy and mortified
pride.&hellip; From the period of which we
have been speaking, Mr. Henry became the idol
of the people of Virginia.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor89" id="FNanchor89"></a><a href="#Footnote-89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-83" id="Footnote-83"></a><a href="#FNanchor83"><span class="label">[83]</span></a> As the historic importance of the Virginia resolutions became
more and more apparent, a disposition was manifested to deny to
Patrick Henry the honor of having written them. As early as
1790, Madison, between whom and Henry there was nearly always
a sharp hostility, significantly asked Edmund Pendleton to tell him
&#8220;where the resolutions proposed by Mr. Henry really originated.&#8221;
<i>Letters and Other Writings of Madison</i>, i. 515. Edmund Randolph
is said to have asserted that they were written by William Fleming;
a statement of which Jefferson remarked, &#8220;It is to me incomprehensible.&#8221;
<i>Works</i>, vi. 484. But to Jefferson&#8217;s own testimony
on the same subject, I would apply the same remark. In
his Memorandum, he says without hesitation that the resolutions
&#8220;were drawn up by George Johnston, a lawyer of the Northern
Neck, a very able, logical, and correct speaker.&#8221; <i>Hist. Mag.</i> for
1867, 91. But in another paper, written at about the same time,
Jefferson said: &#8220;I can readily enough believe these resolutions
were written by Mr. Henry himself. They bear the stamp of his
mind, strong, without precision. That they were written by Johnston,
who seconded them, was only the rumor of the day, and
very possibly unfounded.&#8221; <i>Works</i>, vi. 484. In the face of all
this tissue of rumor, guesswork, and self-contradiction, the deliberate
statement of Patrick Henry himself that he wrote the five
resolutions referred to by him, and that he wrote them &#8220;alone,
unadvised, and unassisted,&#8221; must close the discussion.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VII <br />
<span class="hsub">STEADY WORK</span></h2>


<p>From the close of Patrick Henry&#8217;s first term in
the Virginia House of Burgesses, in the spring of
1765, to the opening of his first term in the Continental
Congress, in the fall of 1774, there stretches
a period of about nine years, which, for the purposes
of our present study, may be rapidly glanced
at and passed by.</p>

<p>In general, it may be described as a period
during which he had settled down to steady work,
both as a lawyer and as a politician. The first
five years of his professional life had witnessed his
advance, as we have seen, by strides which only
genius can make, from great obscurity to great
distinction; his advance from a condition of universal
failure to one of success so universal that
his career may be said to have become within that
brief period solidly established. At the bar, upon
the hustings, in the legislature, as a master of
policies, as a leader of men, he had already proved
himself to be, of his kind, without a peer in all
the colony of Virginia,&mdash;a colony which was then
the prolific mother of great men. With him,
therefore, the period of training and of tentative
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
struggle had passed: the period now entered upon
was one of recognized mastership and of assured
performance, along lines certified by victories that
came gayly, and apparently at his slightest call.</p>

<p>We note, at the beginning of this period, an
event indicating substantial prosperity in his life:
he acquires the visible dignity of a country-seat.
Down to the end of 1763, and probably even to
the summer of 1765, he had continued to live in
the neighborhood of Hanover Court House. After
coming back from his first term of service in the
House of Burgesses, where he had sat as member
for the county of Louisa, he removed his residence
into that county, and established himself there
upon an estate called Roundabout, purchased by
him of his father. In 1768 he returned to Hanover,
and in 1771 he bought a place in that county
called Scotch Town, which continued to be his seat
until shortly after the Declaration of Independence,
when, having become governor of the new
State of Virginia, he took up his residence at
Williamsburg, in the palace long occupied by the
official representatives of royalty.</p>

<p>For the practice of his profession, the earlier
portion of this period was perhaps not altogether
unfavorable. The political questions then in debate
were, indeed, exciting, but they had not quite
reached the ultimate issue, and did not yet demand
from him the complete surrender of his life. Those
years seem to have been marked by great professional
activity on his part, and by considerable
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
growth in his reputation, even for the higher and
more difficult work of the law. Of course, as the
vast controversy between the colonists and Great
Britain grew in violence, all controversies between
one colonist and another began to seem petty, and
to be postponed; even the courts ceased to meet
with much regularity, and finally ceased to meet at
all; while Patrick Henry himself, forsaking his
private concerns, became entirely absorbed in the
concerns of the public.</p>

<p>The fluctuations in his engagements as a lawyer,
during all these years, may be traced with some
certainty by the entries in his fee-books. For the
year 1765, he charges fees in 547 cases; for 1766,
in 114 cases; for 1767, in 554 cases; for 1768, in
354 cases. With the next year there begins a
great falling off in the number of his cases; and
the decline continues till 1774, when, in the convulsions
of the time, his practice stops altogether.
Thus, for 1769, there are registered 132 cases;
for 1770, 94 cases; for 1771, 102 cases; for 1772,
43 cases; for 1773, 7 cases; and for 1774, none.<a name="FNanchor90" id="FNanchor90"></a><a href="#Footnote-90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>The character of the professional work done by
him during this period deserves a moment&#8217;s consideration.
Prior to 1769, he had limited himself
to practice in the courts of the several counties.
In that year he began to practice in the general
court,&mdash;the highest court in the colony,&mdash;where
of course were tried the most important and difficult
causes, and where thenceforward he had
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
constantly to encounter the most learned and
acute lawyers at the bar, including such men as
Pendleton, Wythe, Blair, Mercer, John Randolph,
Thompson Mason, Thomas Jefferson, and Robert
C. Nicholas.<a name="FNanchor91" id="FNanchor91"></a><a href="#Footnote-91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>There could never have been any doubt of his
supreme competency to deal with such criminal
causes as he had to manage in that court or in any
other; and with respect to the conduct of other
than criminal causes, all purely contemporaneous
evidence, now to be had, implies that he had not
ventured to present himself before the higher tribunals
of the land until he had qualified himself
to bear his part there with success and honor.
Thus, the instance may be mentioned of his appearing
in the Court of Admiralty, &#8220;in behalf of
a Spanish captain, whose vessel and cargo had
been libeled. A gentleman who was present, and
who was very well qualified to judge, was heard to
declare, after the trial was over, that he never
heard a more eloquent or argumentative speech in
his life; that Mr. Henry was on that occasion
greatly superior to Mr. Pendleton, Mr. Mason, or
any other counsel who spoke to the subject; and
that he was astonished how Mr. Henry could have
acquired such a knowledge of the maritime law, to
which it was believed he had never before turned
his attention.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor92" id="FNanchor92"></a><a href="#Footnote-92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Moreover, in 1771, just two
years from the time when Patrick Henry began
practice in the General Court, Robert C. Nicholas,<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
then a veteran member of the profession, &#8220;who
had enjoyed the first practice at the bar,&#8221; had
occasion to retire, and began looking about among
the younger men for some competent lawyer to
whom he might safely intrust the unfinished business
of his clients. He first offered his practice to
Thomas Jefferson, who, however, was compelled
to decline it. Afterward, he offered it to Patrick
Henry, who accepted it; and accordingly, by public
advertisement, Nicholas informed his clients
that he had committed to Patrick Henry the further
protection of their interests,<a name="FNanchor93" id="FNanchor93"></a><a href="#Footnote-93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>&mdash;a perfectly
conclusive proof, it should seem, of the real respect
in which Patrick Henry&#8217;s qualifications as a lawyer
were then held, not only by the public but by the
profession. Certainly such evidence as this can
hardly be set aside by the supposed recollections
of one old gentleman, of broken memory and unbroken
resentment, who long afterward tried to
convince Wirt that, even at the period now in
question, Patrick Henry was &#8220;wofully deficient as
a lawyer,&#8221; was unable to contend with his associates
&#8220;on a mere question of law,&#8221; and was &#8220;so
little acquainted with the fundamental principles
of his profession &hellip; as not to be able to see the
remote bearings of the reported cases.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor94" id="FNanchor94"></a><a href="#Footnote-94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The expressions
here quoted are, apparently, Wirt&#8217;s own
paraphrase of the statements which were made to
him by Jefferson, and which, in many of their
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
details, can now be proved, on documentary evidence,
to be the work of a hand that had forgot,
not indeed its cunning, but at any rate its accuracy.</p>

<p>As to the political history of Patrick Henry
during this period, it may be easily described.
The doctrine on which he had planted himself by
his resolutions in 1765, namely, that the parliamentary
taxation of unrepresented colonies is unconstitutional,
became the avowed doctrine of Virginia,
and of all her sister colonies; and nearly all
the men who, in the House of Burgesses, had, for
reasons of propriety, or of expediency, or of personal
feeling, opposed the passage of his resolutions,
soon took pains to make it known to their
constituents that their opposition had not been to
the principle which those resolutions expressed.
Thenceforward, among the leaders in Virginian
politics, there was no real disagreement on the
fundamental question; only such disagreement
touching methods as must always occur between
spirits who are cautious and spirits who are bold.
Chief among the former were Pendleton, Wythe,
Bland, Peyton Randolph, and Nicholas. In the
van of the latter always stood Patrick Henry, and
with him Jefferson, Richard Henry Lee, the
Pages, and George Mason. But between the two
groups, after all, was surprising harmony, which
is thus explained by one who in all that business
had a great part and who never was a laggard:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;Sensible, however, of the importance of unanimity
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
among our constituents, although we often wished to
have gone faster, we slackened our pace, that our less
ardent colleagues might keep up with us; and they, on
their part, differing nothing from us in principle, quickened
their gait somewhat beyond that which their prudence
might of itself have advised, and thus consolidated
the phalanx which breasted the power of Britain. By
this harmony of the bold with the cautious, we advanced
with our constituents in undivided mass, and with fewer
examples of separation than, perhaps, existed in any
other part of the union.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor95" id="FNanchor95"></a><a href="#Footnote-95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>
</div>

<p>All deprecated a quarrel with Great Britain;
all deprecated as a boundless calamity the possible
issue of independence; all desired to remain in
loyal, free, and honorable connection with the
British empire; and against the impending danger
of an assault upon the freedom, and consequently
the honor, of this connection, all stood on guard.</p>

<p>One result, however, of this practical unanimity
among the leaders in Virginia was the absence,
during all this period, of those impassioned and
dramatic conflicts in debate, which would have
called forth historic exhibitions of Patrick Henry&#8217;s
eloquence and of his gifts for conduct and command.
He had a leading part in all the counsels
of the time; he was sent to every session of the
House of Burgesses; he was at the front in all
local committees and conventions; he was made a
member of the first Committee of Correspondence;
and all these incidents in this portion of his life
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
culminated in his mission as one of the deputies
from Virginia to the first Continental Congress.</p>

<p>Without here going into the familiar story of
the occasion and purposes of the Congress of 1774,
we may briefly indicate Patrick Henry&#8217;s relation
to the events in Virginia which immediately preceded
his appointment to that renowned assemblage.
On the 24th of May, 1774, the House of
Burgesses, having received the alarming news of
the passage of the Boston Port Bill, designated
the day on which that bill was to take effect&mdash;the
first day of June&mdash;&#8220;as a day of fasting, humiliation,
and prayer, devoutly to implore the Divine
interposition for averting the heavy calamity
which threatens destruction to our civil rights,
and the evils of civil war; to give us one heart
and one mind firmly to oppose, by all just and
proper means, every injury to American rights;
and that the minds of his majesty and his parliament
may be inspired from above with wisdom,
moderation, and justice, to remove from the loyal
people of America all cause of danger, from a
continued pursuit of measures pregnant with their
ruin.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor96" id="FNanchor96"></a><a href="#Footnote-96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Two days afterward, the governor, Lord
Dunmore, having summoned the House to the
council chamber, made to them this little speech:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;Mr. Speaker and gentlemen of the House of Burgesses,
I have in my hand a paper published by order of
your House, conceived in such terms as reflect highly
upon his majesty and the Parliament of Great Britain,<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
which makes it necessary for me to dissolve you, and
you are dissolved accordingly.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor97" id="FNanchor97"></a><a href="#Footnote-97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>
</div>

<p>At ten o&#8217;clock on the following day, May 27,
the members of the late House met by agreement
at the Raleigh Tavern, and there promptly passed
a nobly-worded resolution, deploring the policy
pursued by Parliament and suggesting the establishment
of an annual congress of all the colonies,
&#8220;to deliberate on those general measures which
the united interests of America may from time to
time require.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor98" id="FNanchor98"></a><a href="#Footnote-98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>During the anxious days and nights immediately
preceding the dissolution of the House, its prominent
members held many private conferences with
respect to the course to be pursued by Virginia.
In all these conferences, as we are told, &#8220;Patrick
Henry was the leader;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor99" id="FNanchor99"></a><a href="#Footnote-99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and a very able man,
George Mason, who was just then a visitor at
Williamsburg, and was admitted to the consultations
of the chiefs, wrote at the time concerning
him: &#8220;He is by far the most powerful speaker I
ever heard.&hellip; But his eloquence is the smallest
part of his merit. He is, in my opinion, the first
man upon this continent, as well in abilities as
public virtues.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor100" id="FNanchor100"></a><a href="#Footnote-100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p><span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
In response to a recommendation made by leading
members of the recent House of Burgesses, a
convention of delegates from the several counties
of Virginia assembled at Williamsburg, on August
1, 1774, to deal with the needs of the hour, and
especially to appoint deputies to the proposed
congress at Philadelphia. The spirit in which
this convention transacted its business is sufficiently
shown in the opening paragraphs of the letter of
instructions which it gave to the deputies whom it
sent to the congress:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The unhappy disputes between Great Britain and
her American colonies, which began about the third year
of the reign of his present majesty, and since, continually
increasing, have proceeded to lengths so dangerous
and alarming as to excite just apprehensions in the
minds of his majesty&#8217;s faithful subjects of this colony
that they are in danger of being deprived of their natural,
ancient, constitutional, and chartered rights, have
compelled them to take the same into their most serious
consideration; and being deprived of their usual and
accustomed mode of making known their grievances,
have appointed us their representatives, to consider what
is proper to be done in this dangerous crisis of American
affairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;It being our opinion that the united wisdom of North
America should be collected in a general congress of all
the colonies, we have appointed the honorable Peyton
Randolph, Esquire, Richard Henry Lee, George Washington,
Patrick Henry, Richard Bland, Benjamin Harrison,
and Edmund Pendleton, Esquires, deputies to
represent this colony in the said congress, to be held at
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
Philadelphia on the first Monday in September next.
And that they may be the better informed of our sentiments
touching the conduct we wish them to observe on
this important occasion, we desire that they will express,
in the first place, our faith and true allegiance to his
majesty King George the Third, our lawful and rightful
sovereign; and that we are determined, with our lives
and fortunes, to support him in the legal exercise of all
his just rights and prerogatives; and however misrepresented,
we sincerely approve of a constitutional connection
with Great Britain, and wish most ardently a return
of that intercourse of affection and commercial connection
that formerly united both countries; which can only
be effected by a removal of those causes of discontent
which have of late unhappily divided us.&hellip; The
power assumed by the British Parliament to bind America
by their statutes, in all cases whatsoever, is unconstitutional,
and the source of these unhappy differences.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor101" id="FNanchor101"></a><a href="#Footnote-101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The convention at Williamsburg, of which, of
course, Patrick Henry was a member, seems to
have adjourned on Saturday, the 6th of August.
Between that date and the time for his departure
to attend the congress at Philadelphia, we may
imagine him as busily engaged in arranging his
affairs for a long absence from home, and even
then as not getting ready to begin the long journey
until many of his associates had nearly reached
the end of it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII <br />
<span class="hsub">IN THE FIRST CONTINENTAL CONGRESS</span></h2>


<p>On the morning of Tuesday, the 30th of August,
Patrick Henry arrived on horseback at Mt. Vernon,
the home of his friend and colleague, George
Washington; and having remained there that day
and night, he set out for Philadelphia on the following
morning, in the company of Washington
and of Edmund Pendleton. From the jottings in
Washington&#8217;s diary,<a name="FNanchor102" id="FNanchor102"></a><a href="#Footnote-102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> we can so far trace the progress
of this trio of illustrious horsemen, as to
ascertain that on Sunday, the 4th of September,
they &#8220;breakfasted at Christiana Ferry; dined at
Chester;&#8221; and reached Philadelphia for supper&mdash;thus
arriving in town barely in time to be present
at the first meeting of the Congress on the morning
of the 5th.</p>

<p>John Adams had taken pains to get upon the
ground nearly a week earlier; and carefully gathering
all possible information concerning his future
associates, few of whom he had then ever seen, he
wrote in his diary that the Virginians were said
to &#8220;speak in raptures about Richard Henry Lee
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
and Patrick Henry, one the Cicero, and the other
the Demosthenes, of the age.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor103" id="FNanchor103"></a><a href="#Footnote-103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Not far from the same time, also, a keen-witted
Virginian, Roger Atkinson, at his home near Petersburg,
was writing to a friend about the men
who had gone to represent Virginia in the great
Congress; and this letter of his, though not meant
for posterity, has some neat, off-hand portraits
which posterity may, nevertheless, be glad to look
at. Peyton Randolph is &#8220;a venerable man &hellip;
an honest man; has knowledge, temper, experience,
judgment,&mdash;above all, integrity; a true
Roman spirit.&#8221; Richard Bland is &#8220;a wary, old,
experienced veteran at the bar and in the senate;
has something of the look of old musty parchments,
which he handleth and studieth much. He formerly
wrote a treatise against the Quakers on
water-baptism.&#8221; Washington &#8220;is a soldier,&mdash;a
warrior; he is a modest man; sensible; speaks
little; in action cool, like a bishop at his prayers.&#8221;
Pendleton &#8220;is an humble and religious man, and
must be exalted. He is a smooth-tongued speaker,
and, though not so old, may be compared to old
Nestor,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8216;Experienced Nestor, in persuasion skilled,<br />
Words sweet as honey from his lips distilled.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Patrick Henry &#8220;is a real half-Quaker,&mdash;your
brother&#8217;s man,&mdash;moderate and mild, and in
religious matters a saint; but the very devil in
politics; a son of thunder. He will shake the
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Senate. Some years ago he had liked to have
talked treason into the House.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor104" id="FNanchor104"></a><a href="#Footnote-104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>Few of the members of this Congress had ever
met before; and if all had arrived upon the scene
as late as did these three members from Virginia,
there might have been some difficulty, through a
lack of previous consultation and acquaintance, in
organizing the Congress on the day appointed, and
in entering at once upon its business. In fact,
however, more than a week before the time for the
first meeting, the delegates had begun to make
their appearance in Philadelphia; thenceforward
with each day the arrivals continued; by Thursday,
the 1st of September, twenty-five delegates,
nearly one half of the entire body elected, were in
town;<a name="FNanchor105" id="FNanchor105"></a><a href="#Footnote-105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and probably, during all that week, no
day and no night had passed without many an informal
conference respecting the business before
them, and the best way of doing it.</p>

<p>Concerning these memorable men of the first
Continental Congress, it must be confessed that as
the mists of a hundred years of glorifying oratory
and of semi-poetic history have settled down upon
them, they are now enveloped in a light which
seems to distend their forms to proportions almost
superhuman, and to cast upon their faces a gravity
that hardly belongs to this world; and it may,
perhaps, help us to bring them and their work
somewhat nearer to the plane of natural human
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
life and motive, and into a light that is as the
light of reality, if, turning to the daily memoranda
made at the time by one of their number, we can
see how merrily, after all, nay, with what flowing
feasts, with what convivial communings, passed
those days and nights of preparation for the difficult
business they were about to take in hand.</p>

<p>For example, on Monday, the 29th of August,
when the four members of the Massachusetts delegation
had arrived within five miles of the city,
they were met by an escort of gentlemen, partly
residents of Philadelphia, and partly delegates
from other colonies, who had come out in carriages
to greet them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;We were introduced,&#8221; writes John Adams, &#8220;to all
these gentlemen, and most cordially welcomed to Philadelphia.
We then rode into town, and dirty, dusty, and
fatigued as we were, we could not resist the importunity
to go to the tavern, the most genteel one in America.
There we were introduced to a number of other gentlemen
of the city, &hellip; and to Mr. Lynch and Mr. Gadsden,
of South Carolina. Here we had a fresh welcome
to the city of Philadelphia; and after some time spent
in conversation, a curtain was drawn, and in the other
half of the chamber a supper appeared as elegant as ever
was laid upon a table. About eleven o&#8217;clock we retired.</p>

<p>&#8220;30, Tuesday. Walked a little about town; visited
the market, the State House, the Carpenters&#8217; Hall, where
the Congress is to sit, etc.; then called at Mr. Mifflin&#8217;s,
a grand, spacious, and elegant house. Here we had
much conversation with Mr. Charles Thomson, who is
&hellip; the Sam Adams of Philadelphia, the life of the
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
cause of liberty, they say. A Friend, Collins, came to
see us, and invited us to dine on Thursday. We returned
to our lodgings, and Mr. Lynch, Mr. Gadsden,
Mr. Middleton, and young Mr. Rutledge came to visit us.</p>

<p>&#8220;31, Wednesday. Breakfasted at Mr. Bayard&#8217;s, of
Philadelphia, with Mr. Sprout, a Presbyterian minister.
Made a visit to Governor Ward of Rhode Island, at his
lodgings. There we were introduced to several gentlemen.
Mr. Dickinson, the Farmer of Pennsylvania,
came in his coach with four beautiful horses to Mr.
Ward&#8217;s lodgings, to see us.&hellip; We dined with Mr.
Lynch, his lady and daughter, at their lodgings, &hellip;
and a very agreeable dinner and afternoon we had, notwithstanding
the violent heat. We were all vastly
pleased with Mr. Lynch. He is a solid, firm, judicious
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;September 1, Thursday. This day we breakfasted
at Mr. Mifflin&#8217;s. Mr. C. Thomson came in, and soon
after Dr. Smith, the famous Dr. Smith, the provost of
the college.&hellip; We then went to return visits to the
gentlemen who had visited us. We visited a Mr. Cadwallader,
a gentleman of large fortune, a grand and elegant
house and furniture. We then visited Mr. Powell,
another splendid seat. We then visited the gentlemen
from South Carolina, and, about twelve, were introduced
to Mr. Galloway, the speaker of the House in Pennsylvania.
We dined at Friend Collins&#8217; &hellip; with Governor
Hopkins, Governor Ward, Mr. Galloway, Mr. Rhoades,
etc. In the evening all the gentlemen of the Congress
who were arrived in town, met at Smith&#8217;s, the new city
tavern, and spent the evening together. Twenty-five
members were come. Virginia, North Carolina, Maryland,
and the city of New York were not arrived.<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;2, Friday. Dined at Mr. Thomas Mifflin&#8217;s with
Mr. Lynch, Mr. Middleton, and the two Rutledges with
their ladies.&hellip; We were very sociable and happy.
After coffee we went to the tavern, where we were introduced
to Peyton Randolph, Esquire, speaker of Virginia,
Colonel Harrison, Richard Henry Lee, Esquire,
and Colonel Bland.&hellip; These gentlemen from Virginia
appear to be the most spirited and consistent of
any. Harrison said he would have come on foot rather
than not come. Bland said he would have gone, upon
this occasion, if it had been to Jericho.</p>

<p>&#8220;3, Saturday. Breakfasted at Dr. Shippen&#8217;s; Dr.
Witherspoon was there. Col. R. H. Lee lodges there;
he is a masterly man.&hellip; We went with Mr. William
Barrell to his store, and drank punch, and ate dried
smoked sprats with him; read the papers and our letters
from Boston; dined with Mr. Joseph Reed, the
lawyer; &hellip; spent the evening at Mr. Mifflin&#8217;s, with
Lee and Harrison from Virginia, the two Rutledges, Dr.
Witherspoon, Dr. Shippen, Dr. Steptoe, and another
gentleman; an elegant supper, and we drank sentiments
till eleven o&#8217;clock. Lee and Harrison were very high.
Lee had dined with Mr. Dickinson, and drank Burgundy
the whole afternoon.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor106" id="FNanchor106"></a><a href="#Footnote-106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Accordingly, at 10 o&#8217;clock on Monday morning,
the 5th of September, when the delegates assembled
at their rendezvous, the city tavern, and
marched together through the streets to Carpenters&#8217;
Hall, for most of them the stiffness of a first introduction
was already broken, and they could
greet one another that morning with something of
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
the freedom and good fellowship of boon companions.
Moreover, they were then ready to proceed
to business under the advantage of having arranged
beforehand an outline of what was first to be done.
It had been discovered, apparently, that the first
serious question which would meet them after
their formal organization, was one relating to the
method of voting in the Congress, namely, whether
each deputy should have a vote, or only each colony;
and if the latter, whether the vote of each
colony should be proportioned to its population
and property.</p>

<p>Having arrived at the hall, and inspected it,
and agreed that it would serve the purpose, the
delegates helped themselves to seats. Then Mr.
Lynch of South Carolina arose, and nominated
Mr. Peyton Randolph of Virginia for president.
This nomination having been unanimously adopted,
Mr. Lynch likewise proposed Mr. Charles Thomson
for secretary, which was carried without opposition;
but as Mr. Thomson was not a delegate,
and of course was not then present, the doorkeeper
was instructed to go out and find him, and say to
him that his immediate attendance was desired by
the Congress.</p>

<p>Next came the production and inspection of credentials.
The roll indicated that of the fifty-two
delegates appointed, forty-four were already upon
the ground,&mdash;constituting an assemblage of representative
Americans, which, for dignity of character
and for intellectual eminence, was undoubtedly the
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
most imposing that the colonies had ever seen.
In that room that day were such men as John
Sullivan, John and Samuel Adams, Stephen Hopkins,
Roger Sherman, James Duane, John Jay,
Philip and William Livingston, Joseph Galloway,
Thomas Mifflin, C&aelig;sar Rodney, Thomas McKean,
George Read, Samuel Chase, John and Edward
Rutledge, Christopher Gadsden, Henry Middleton,
Edmund Pendleton, George Washington, and
Patrick Henry.</p>

<p>Having thus got through with the mere routine
of organization, which must have taken a considerable
time, James Duane, of New York, moved the
appointment of a committee &#8220;to prepare regulations
for this Congress.&#8221; To this several gentlemen
objected; whereupon John Adams, thinking
that Duane&#8217;s purpose might have been misunderstood,
&#8220;asked leave of the president to request of
the gentleman from New York an explanation,
and that he would point out some particular regulations
which he had in his mind.&#8221; In reply to
this request, Duane &#8220;mentioned particularly the
method of voting, whether it should be by colonies,
or by the poll, or by interests.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor107" id="FNanchor107"></a><a href="#Footnote-107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Thus Duane
laid his finger on perhaps the most sensitive nerve
in that assemblage; but as he sat down, the discussion
of the subject which he had mentioned was
interrupted by a rather curious incident. This
was the return of the doorkeeper, having under his
escort Mr. Charles Thomson. The latter walked
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
up the aisle, and standing opposite to the president,
said, with a bow, that he awaited his pleasure.
The president replied: &#8220;Congress desire the favor
of you, sir, to take their minutes.&#8221; Without a
word, only bowing his acquiescence, the secretary
took his seat at his desk, and began those modest
but invaluable services from which he did not
cease until the Congress of the Confederation was
merged into that of the Union.</p>

<p>The discussion, into which this incident had
fallen as a momentary episode, was then resumed.
&#8220;After a short silence,&#8221; says the man who was
thus inducted into office, &#8220;Patrick Henry arose to
speak. I did not then know him. He was dressed
in a suit of parson&#8217;s gray, and from his appearance
I took him for a Presbyterian clergyman, used to
haranguing the people. He observed that we were
here met in a time and on an occasion of great
difficulty and distress; that our public circumstances
were like those of a man in deep embarrassment
and trouble, who had called his friends together
to devise what was best to be done for his
relief;&mdash;one would propose one thing, and another
a different one, whilst perhaps a third would think
of something better suited to his unhappy circumstances,
which he would embrace, and think no
more of the rejected schemes with which he would
have nothing to do.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor108" id="FNanchor108"></a><a href="#Footnote-108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p><span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Such is the rather meagre account, as given by
one ear-witness, of Patrick Henry&#8217;s first speech in
the Congress of 1774. From another ear-witness
we have another account, likewise very meagre,
but giving, probably, a somewhat more adequate
idea of the drift and point of what he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Mr. Henry then arose, and said this was the first
general congress which had ever happened; that no
former congress could be a precedent; that we should
have occasion for more general congresses, and therefore
that a precedent ought to be established now; that it
would be a great injustice if a little colony should have
the same weight in the councils of America as a great
one; and therefore he was for a committee.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor109" id="FNanchor109"></a><a href="#Footnote-109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The notable thing about both these accounts is
that they agree in showing Patrick Henry&#8217;s first
speech in Congress to have been not, as has been
represented, an impassioned portrayal of &#8220;general
grievances,&#8221; but a plain and quiet handling of a
mere &#8220;detail of business.&#8221; In the discussion he
was followed by John Sullivan, who merely observed
that &#8220;a little colony had its all at stake as
well as a great one.&#8221; The floor was then taken
by John Adams, who seems to have made a searching
and vigorous argument,&mdash;exhibiting the great
difficulties attending any possible conclusion to
which they might come respecting the method of
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
voting. At the end of his speech, apparently, the
House adjourned, to resume the consideration of
the subject on the following day.<a name="FNanchor110" id="FNanchor110"></a><a href="#Footnote-110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Accordingly, on Tuesday morning the discussion
was continued, and at far greater length than on
the previous day; the first speaker being Patrick
Henry himself, who seems now to have gone into
the subject far more broadly, and with much greater
intensity of thought, than in his first speech.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Government,&#8217; said he, &#8216;is dissolved. Fleets and
armies and the present state of things show that government
is dissolved. Where are your landmarks, your
boundaries of colonies? We are in a state of nature,
sir. I did propose that a scale should be laid down;
that part of North America which was once Massachusetts
Bay, and that part which was once Virginia, ought
to be considered as having a weight. Will not people
complain,&mdash;&#8220;Ten thousand Virginians have not outweighed
one thousand others?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I will submit, however; I am determined to submit,
if I am overruled.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;A worthy gentleman near me [John Adams] seemed
to admit the necessity of obtaining a more adequate
representation.<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I hope future ages will quote our proceedings with
applause. It is one of the great duties of the democratical
part of the constitution to keep itself pure. It
is known in my province that some other colonies are
not so numerous or rich as they are. I am for giving
all the satisfaction in my power.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The distinctions between Virginians, Pennsylvanians,
New Yorkers, and New Englanders are no more.
I am not a Virginian, but an American.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Slaves are to be thrown out of the question; and if
the freemen can be represented according to their numbers,
I am satisfied.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The subject was then debated at length by Lynch,
Rutledge, Ward, Richard Henry Lee, Gadsden, Bland,
and Pendleton, when Patrick Henry again rose:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I agree that authentic accounts cannot be had, if
by authenticity is meant attestations of officers of the
crown. I go upon the supposition that government is at
an end. All distinctions are thrown down. All America
is thrown into one mass. We must aim at the minuti&aelig;
of rectitude.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Patrick Henry was then followed by John Jay,
who seems to have closed the debate, and whose
allusion to what his immediate predecessor had
said gives us some hint of the variations in Revolutionary
opinion then prevailing among the members,
as well as of the advanced position always
taken by Patrick Henry:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;&#8216;Could I suppose that we came to frame an American
constitution, instead of endeavoring to correct the faults
in an old one, I can&#8217;t yet think that all government is
at an end. The measure of arbitrary power is not full;<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
and I think it must run over, before we undertake to
frame a new constitution. To the virtue, spirit, and
abilities of Virginia we owe much. I should always,
therefore, from inclination as well as justice, be for giving
Virginia its full weight. I am not clear that we
ought not to be bound by a majority, though ever so
small; but I only mentioned it as a matter of danger
worthy of consideration.&#8217;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor111" id="FNanchor111"></a><a href="#Footnote-111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Of this entire debate, the most significant issue
is indicated by the following passage from the
journal for Tuesday, the 6th of September:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;<i>Resolved</i>, that in determining questions in this Congress,
each colony or province shall have one vote; the
Congress not being possessed of, or at present able to
procure, proper materials for ascertaining the importance
of each colony.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor112" id="FNanchor112"></a><a href="#Footnote-112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>
</div>

<p>So far as it is now possible to ascertain it, such
was Patrick Henry&#8217;s part in the first discussion
held by the first Continental Congress,&mdash;a discussion
occupying parts of two days, and relating
purely to methods of procedure by that body, and
not to the matters of grievance between the colonies
and Great Britain. We have a right to infer
something as to the quality of the first impression
made upon his associates by Patrick Henry in
consequence of his three speeches in this discussion,
from the fact that when, at the close of it, an
order was taken for the appointment of two grand
committees, one &#8220;to state the rights of the colonies,&#8221;
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
the other &#8220;to examine and report the several
statutes which affect the trade and manufactures
of the colonies,&#8221; Patrick Henry was chosen to
represent Virginia on the latter
committee,<a name="FNanchor113" id="FNanchor113"></a><a href="#Footnote-113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>&mdash;a
position not likely to have been selected for a man
who, however eloquent he may have seemed, had
not also shown business-like and lawyer-like qualities.</p>

<p>The Congress kept steadily at work from Monday,
the 5th of September, to Wednesday, the
26th of October,&mdash;just seven weeks and two days.
Though not a legislative body, it resembled all
legislative bodies then in existence, in the fact
that it sat with closed doors, and that it gave to
the public only such results as it chose to give.
Upon the difficult and exciting subjects which
came before it, there were, very likely, many
splendid passages of debate; and we cannot doubt
that in all these discussions Patrick Henry took
his usually conspicuous and powerful share. Yet
no official record was kept of what was said by any
member; and it is only from the hurried private
memoranda of two of his colleagues that we are
able to learn anything more respecting Patrick
Henry&#8217;s participation in the debates of those seven
weeks.</p>

<p>For example, just two weeks after the opening
of this Congress, one of its most critical members,
Silas Deane of Connecticut, in a letter to his wife,
gave some capital sketches of his more prominent
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
associates there, especially those from the South,&mdash;as
Randolph, Harrison, Washington, Pendleton,
Richard Henry Lee, and Patrick Henry.
The latter he describes as &#8220;a lawyer, and the
completest speaker I ever heard. If his future
speeches are equal to the small samples he has
hitherto given us, they will be worth preserving;
but in a letter I can give you no idea of the music
of his voice, or the high-wrought yet natural elegance
of his style and manner.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor114" id="FNanchor114"></a><a href="#Footnote-114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>It was on the 28th of September that Joseph
Galloway brought forward his celebrated plan for
a permanent reconciliation between Great Britain
and her colonies. This was simply a scheme for
what we should now call home rule, on a basis of
colonial confederation, with an American parliament
to be elected every three years by the legislatures
of the several colonies, and with a governor-general
to be appointed by the crown. The
plan came very near to adoption.<a name="FNanchor115" id="FNanchor115"></a><a href="#Footnote-115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> The member
who introduced it was a man of great ability and
great influence; it was supported by James Duane
and John Jay; it was pronounced by Edward Rutledge
to be &#8220;almost a perfect plan;&#8221; and in the
final trial it was lost only by a vote of six colonies
to five. Could it have been adopted, the disruption
of the British empire would certainly have
been averted for that epoch, and, as an act of violence
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
and of unkindness, would perhaps have been
averted forever; while the thirteen English colonies
would have remained English colonies, without
ceasing to be free.</p>

<p>The plan, however, was distrusted and resisted,
with stern and implacable hostility, by the more
radical members of the Congress, particularly by
those from Massachusetts and Virginia; and an
outline of what Patrick Henry said in his assault
upon it, delivered on the very day on which it was
introduced, is thus given by John Adams:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;The original constitution of the colonies was founded
on the broadest and most generous base. The regulation
of our trade was compensation enough for all the
protection we ever experienced from her.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall liberate our constituents from a corrupt
House of Commons, but throw them into the arms of an
American legislature, that may be bribed by that nation
which avows, in the face of the world, that bribery is a
part of her system of government.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before we are obliged to pay taxes as they do, let
us be as free as they; let us have our trade open with
all the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are not to consent by the representatives of
representatives.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am inclined to think the present measures lead to
war.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor116" id="FNanchor116"></a><a href="#Footnote-116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The only other trace to be discovered of Patrick
Henry&#8217;s activity in the debates of this Congress
belongs to the day just before the one on which
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Galloway&#8217;s plan was introduced. The subject
then under discussion was the measure for non-importation
and non-exportation. On considerations
of forbearance, Henry tried to have the date
for the application of this measure postponed from
November to December, saying, characteristically,
&#8220;We don&#8217;t mean to hurt even our rascals, if we
have any.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor117" id="FNanchor117"></a><a href="#Footnote-117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>Probably the most notable work done by this
Congress was its preparation of those masterly
state papers in which it interpreted and affirmed
the constitutional attitude of the colonies, and
which, when laid upon the table of the House of
Lords, drew forth the splendid encomium of Chatham.<a name="FNanchor118" id="FNanchor118"></a><a href="#Footnote-118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
In many respects the most important, and
certainly the most difficult, of these state papers,
was the address to the king. The motion for such
an address was made on the 1st of October. On
the same day the preparation of it was entrusted
to a very able committee, consisting of Richard
Henry Lee, John Adams, Thomas Johnson, Patrick
Henry, and John Rutledge; and on the 21st
of October the committee was strengthened by the
accession of John Dickinson, who had entered the
Congress but four days before.<a name="FNanchor119" id="FNanchor119"></a><a href="#Footnote-119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Precisely what
part Patrick Henry took in the preparation of this
address is not now known; but there is no evidence
whatever for the assertion<a name="FNanchor120" id="FNanchor120"></a><a href="#Footnote-120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> that the first draft,<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
which, when submitted to Congress, proved to be
unsatisfactory, was the work of Patrick Henry.
That draft, as is now abundantly proved, was prepared
by the chairman of the committee, Richard
Henry Lee, but after full instructions from Congress
and from the committee itself.<a name="FNanchor121" id="FNanchor121"></a><a href="#Footnote-121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> In its final
form, the address was largely moulded by the expert
and gentle hand of John Dickinson.<a name="FNanchor122" id="FNanchor122"></a><a href="#Footnote-122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> No one
can doubt, however, that even though Patrick
Henry may have contributed nothing to the literary
execution of this fine address, he was not inactive
in its construction,<a name="FNanchor123" id="FNanchor123"></a><a href="#Footnote-123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> and that he was not
likely to have suggested any abatement from its
free and manly spirit.</p>

<p>The only other committee on which he is known
to have served during this Congress was one to
which his name was added on the 19th of September,&mdash;&#8220;the
committee appointed to state the rights
of the colonies,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor124" id="FNanchor124"></a><a href="#Footnote-124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> an object, certainly, far better
suited to the peculiarities of his talents and of his
temper than that of the committee for the conciliation
of a king.</p>

<p>Of course, the one gift in which Patrick Henry
excelled all other men of his time and neighborhood
was the gift of eloquence; and it is not to be
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
doubted that in many other forms of effort, involving,
for example, plain sense, practical experience,
and knowledge of details, he was often equaled,
and perhaps even surpassed, by men who had not
a particle of his genius for oratory. This fact,
the analogue of which is common in the history of
all men of genius, seems to be the basis of an anecdote
which, possibly, is authentic, and which, at
any rate, has been handed down by one who was
always a devoted friend<a name="FNanchor125" id="FNanchor125"></a><a href="#Footnote-125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> of the great orator. It
is said that, after Henry and Lee had made their
first speeches, Samuel Chase of Maryland was so
impressed by their superiority that he walked over
to the seat of one of his colleagues and said: &#8220;We
might as well go home; we are not able to legislate
with these men.&#8221; But some days afterward, perhaps
in the midst of the work of the committee on
the statutes affecting trade and commerce, the
same member was able to relieve himself by the
remark: &#8220;Well, after all, I find these are but
men, and, in mere matters of business, but very
common men.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor126" id="FNanchor126"></a><a href="#Footnote-126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>It seems hardly right to pass from these studies
upon the first Continental Congress, and upon
Patrick Henry&#8217;s part in it, without some reference
to Wirt&#8217;s treatment of the subject in a book which
has now been, for nearly three quarters of a century,
the chief source of public information concerning
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Patrick Henry. There is perhaps no other
portion of this book which is less worthy of respect.<a name="FNanchor127" id="FNanchor127"></a><a href="#Footnote-127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
It is not only unhistoric in nearly all the
very few alleged facts of the narrative, but it does
great injustice to Patrick Henry by representing
him virtually as a mere declaimer, as an ill-instructed
though most impressive rhapsodist in debate,
and as without any claim to the character of
a serious statesman, or even of a man of affairs;
while, by the somewhat grandiose and melodramatic
tone of some portion of the narrative, it is
singularly out of harmony with the real tone of
that famous assemblage,&mdash;an assemblage of Anglo-Saxon
lawyers, politicians, and men of business,
who were probably about as practical and
sober-minded a company as had been got together
for any manly undertaking since that of Runnymede.</p>

<p>Wirt begins by convening his Congress one day
too soon, namely, on the 4th of September, which
was Sunday; and he represents the members as
&#8220;personally strangers&#8221; to one another, and as sitting,
after their preliminary organization, in a
&#8220;long and deep silence,&#8221; the members meanwhile
looking around upon each other with a sort of
helpless anxiety, &#8220;every individual&#8221; being reluctant
&#8220;to open a business so fearfully momentous.&#8221;
But</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;in the midst of this deep and death-like silence, and
just when it was beginning to become painfully embarrassing,<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Mr. Henry arose slowly, as if borne down by
the weight of the subject. After faltering, according
to his habit, through a most impressive exordium, in
which he merely echoed back the consciousness of every
other heart in deploring his inability to do justice to
the occasion, he launched gradually into a recital of the
colonial wrongs. Rising, as he advanced, with the grandeur
of his subject, and glowing at length with all the
majesty and expectation of the occasion, his speech
seemed more than that of mortal man. Even those who
had heard him in all his glory in the House of Burgesses
of Virginia were astonished at the manner in which his
talents seemed to swell and expand themselves to fill the
vaster theatre in which he was now placed. There was
no rant, no rhapsody, no labor of the understanding, no
straining of the voice, no confusion of the utterance.
His countenance was erect, his eye steady, his action
noble, his enunciation clear and firm, his mind poised on
its centre, his views of his subject comprehensive and
great, and his imagination coruscating with a magnificence
and a variety which struck even that assembly
with amazement and awe. He sat down amidst murmurs
of astonishment and applause; and, as he had
been before proclaimed the greatest orator of Virginia,
he was now on every hand admitted to be the first orator
of America.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor128" id="FNanchor128"></a><a href="#Footnote-128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This great speech from Patrick Henry, which
certainly was not made on that occasion, and probably
was never made at all, Wirt causes to be followed
by a great speech from Richard Henry Lee,
although the journal could have informed him that
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Lee was not even in the House on that day.
Moreover, he makes Patrick Henry to be the
author of the unfortunate first draft of the address
to the king,&mdash;a document which was written by
another man; and on this fiction he founds two
or three pages of lamentation and of homily with
reference to Patrick Henry&#8217;s inability to express
himself in writing, in consequence of &#8220;his early
neglect of literature.&#8221; Finally, he thinks it due &#8220;to
historic truth to record that the superior powers&#8221;
of Patrick Henry &#8220;were manifested only in debate;&#8221;
and that, although he and Richard Henry
Lee &#8220;took the undisputed lead in the Assembly,&#8221;
&#8220;during the first days of the session, while general
grievances were the topic,&#8221; yet they were both
&#8220;completely thrown into the shade&#8221; &#8220;when called
down from the heights of declamation to that
severer test of intellectual excellence, the details
of business,&#8221;&mdash;the writer here seeming to forget
that &#8220;general grievances&#8221; were not the topic
&#8220;during the first days of the session,&#8221; and that
the very speeches by which these two men are said
to have made their mark there, were speeches on
mere rules of the House relating to methods of
procedure.<a name="FNanchor129" id="FNanchor129"></a><a href="#Footnote-129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>Since the death of Wirt, and the publication of
the biography of him by Kennedy, it has been
possible for us to ascertain just how the genial
author of &#8220;The Life and Character of Patrick
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Henry&#8221; came to be so gravely misled in this part
of his book. &#8220;The whole passage relative to the
first Congress&#8221; appears to have been composed
from data furnished by Jefferson, who, however,
was not a member of that Congress; and in the
original manuscript the very words of Jefferson
were surrounded with quotation marks, and were
attributed to him by name. When, however, that
great man, who loved not to send out calumnies
into the world with his own name attached to
them, came to inspect this portion of Wirt&#8217;s manuscript,
he was moved by his usual prudence to
write such a letter as drew from Wirt the following
consolatory assurance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;Your repose shall never be endangered by any act
of mine, if I can help it. Immediately on the receipt of
your last letter, and before the manuscript had met any
other eye, I wrote over again the whole passage relative
to the first Congress, omitting the marks of quotation,
and removing your name altogether from the communication.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor130" id="FNanchor130"></a><a href="#Footnote-130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The final adjournment of the first Continental
Congress, it will be remembered, did not occur
until its members had spent together more than
seven weeks of the closest intellectual intimacy.
Surely, no mere declaimer however enchanting, no
sublime babbler on the rights of man, no political
charlatan strutting about for the display of his
preternatural gift of articulate wind, could have
grappled in keen debate, for all those weeks, on
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
the greatest of earthly subjects, with fifty of the
ablest men in America, without exposing to their
view all his own intellectual poverty, and without
losing the very last shred of their intellectual respect
for him. Whatever may have been the impression
formed of Patrick Henry as a mere orator
by his associates in that Congress, nothing can be
plainer than that those men carried with them to
their homes that report of him as a man of extraordinary
intelligence, integrity, and power, which
was the basis of his subsequent fame for many
years among the American people. Long afterward,
John Adams, who formed his estimate of
Patrick Henry chiefly from what he saw of him in
that Congress, and who was never much addicted
to bestowing eulogiums on any man but John
Adams, wrote to Jefferson that &#8220;in the Congress
of 1774 there was not one member, except Patrick
Henry, who appeared &hellip; sensible of the precipice,
or rather the pinnacle, on which we stood,
and had candor and courage enough to acknowledge
it.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor131" id="FNanchor131"></a><a href="#Footnote-131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> To Wirt likewise, a few years later,
the same hard critic of men testified that Patrick
Henry always impressed him as a person &#8220;of deep
reflection, keen sagacity, clear foresight, daring
enterprise, inflexible intrepidity, and untainted
integrity, with an ardent zeal for the liberties, the
honor, and felicity of his country and his species.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor132" id="FNanchor132"></a><a href="#Footnote-132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Of the parting interview between these two
men, at the close of that first period of thorough
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
personal acquaintance, there remains from the
hand of one of them a graphic account that reveals
to us something of the conscious kinship which
seems ever afterward to have bound together their
robust and impetuous natures.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;When Congress,&#8221; says John Adams, &#8220;had finished
their business, as they thought, in the autumn of 1774,
I had with Mr. Henry, before we took leave of each
other, some familiar conversation, in which I expressed
a full conviction that our resolves, declarations of rights,
enumeration of wrongs, petitions, remonstrances, and
addresses, associations, and non-importation agreements,
however they might be expected by the people in America,
and however necessary to cement the union of the
colonies, would be but waste paper in England. Mr.
Henry said they might make some impression among the
people of England, but agreed with me that they would
be totally lost upon the government. I had but just
received a short and hasty letter, written to me by
Major Hawley, of Northampton, containing &#8216;a few
broken hints,&#8217; as he called them, of what he thought was
proper to be done, and concluding<a name="FNanchor133" id="FNanchor133"></a><a href="#Footnote-133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> with these words:
&#8216;After all, we must fight.&#8217; This letter I read to Mr.
Henry, who listened with great attention; and as soon
as I had pronounced the words, &#8216;After all, we must
fight,&#8217; he raised his head, and with an energy and vehemence
that I can never forget, broke out with: &#8216;By
God, I am of that man&#8217;s mind!&#8217;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor134" id="FNanchor134"></a><a href="#Footnote-134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
This anecdote, it may be mentioned, contains
the only instance on record, for any period of Patrick
Henry&#8217;s life, implying his use of what at first
may seem a profane oath. John Adams, upon
whose very fallible memory in old age the story
rests, declares that he did not at the time regard
Patrick Henry&#8217;s words as an oath, but rather as
a solemn asseveration, affirmed religiously, upon
a very great occasion. At any rate, that asseveration
proved to be a prophecy; for from it there
then leaped a flame that lighted up for an instant
the next inevitable stage in the evolution of events,&mdash;the
tragic and bloody outcome of all these wary
lucubrations and devices of the assembled political
wizards of America.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that, at the very time
when the Congress at Philadelphia was busy with
its stern work, the people of Virginia were grappling
with the peril of an Indian war assailing
them from beyond their western mountains. There
has recently been brought to light a letter written
at Hanover, on the 15th of October, 1774, by the
aged mother of Patrick Henry, to a friend living
far out towards the exposed district; and this letter
is a touching memorial both of the general anxiety
over the two concurrent events, and of the motherly
pride and piety of the writer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;My son Patrick has been gone to Philadelphia near
seven weeks. The affairs of Congress are kept with
great secrecy, nobody being allowed to be present. I
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
assure you we have our lowland troubles and fears with
respect to Great Britain. Perhaps our good God may
bring good to us out of these many evils which threaten
us, not only from the mountains but from the seas.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor135" id="FNanchor135"></a><a href="#Footnote-135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX <br />
<span class="hsub">&#8220;AFTER ALL, WE MUST FIGHT&#8221;</span></h2>


<p>We now approach that brilliant passage in the
life of Patrick Henry when, in the presence of
the second revolutionary convention of Virginia,
he proclaimed the futility of all further efforts
for peace, and the instant necessity of preparing for
war.</p>

<p>The speech which he is said to have made on
that occasion has been committed to memory and
declaimed by several generations of American
schoolboys, and is now perhaps familiarly known to
a larger number of the American people than any
other considerable bit of secular prose in our language.
The old church at Richmond, in which he
made this marvelous speech, is in our time visited
every year, as a patriotic shrine, by thousands of
pilgrims, who seek curiously the very spot upon
the floor where the orator is believed to have stood
when he uttered those words of flame. It is chiefly
the tradition of that one speech which to-day keeps
alive, in millions of American homes, the name of
Patrick Henry, and which lifts him, in the popular
faith, almost to the rank of some mythical hero
of romance.<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>In reality, that speech, and the resolutions in
support of which that speech was made, constituted
Patrick Henry&#8217;s individual declaration of war
against Great Britain. But the question is: To
what extent, if any, was he therein original, or
even in advance of his fellow-countrymen, and
particularly of his associates in the Virginia convention?</p>

<p>It is essential to a just understanding of the
history of that crisis in revolutionary thought, and
it is of very high importance, likewise, to the historic
position of Patrick Henry, that no mistake
be committed here; especially that he be not made
the victim of a disastrous reaction from any overstatement<a name="FNanchor136" id="FNanchor136"></a><a href="#Footnote-136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
respecting the precise nature and extent
of the service then rendered by him to the cause
of the Revolution.</p>

<p>We need, therefore, to glance for a moment at
the period between October, 1774, and March,
1775, with the purpose of tracing therein the more
important tokens of the growth of the popular
conviction that a war with Great Britain had become
inevitable, and was to be immediately prepared
for by the several colonies,&mdash;two propositions
which form the substance of all that Patrick
Henry said on the great occasion now before us.</p>

<p>As early as the 21st of October, 1774, the first
Continental Congress, after having suggested all
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
possible methods for averting war, made this solemn
declaration to the people of the colonies:
&#8220;We think ourselves bound in duty to observe to
you that the schemes agitated against these colonies
have been so conducted as to render it prudent
that you should extend your views to mournful
events, and be in all respects prepared for every
emergency.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor137" id="FNanchor137"></a><a href="#Footnote-137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Just six days later, John Dickinson,
a most conservative and peace-loving member
of that Congress, wrote to an American friend in
England: &#8220;I wish for peace ardently; but must
say, delightful as it is, it will come more grateful
by being unexpected. The first act of violence on
the part of administration in America, or the attempt
to reinforce General Gage this winter or
next year, will put the whole continent in arms,
from Nova Scotia to Georgia.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor138" id="FNanchor138"></a><a href="#Footnote-138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> On the following
day, the same prudent statesman wrote to another
American friend, also in England: &#8220;The most
peaceful provinces are now animated; and a civil
war is unavoidable, unless there be a quick change
of British measures.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor139" id="FNanchor139"></a><a href="#Footnote-139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> On the 29th of October,
the eccentric Charles Lee, who was keenly watching
the symptoms of colonial discontent and resistance,
wrote from Philadelphia to an English nobleman:
&#8220;Virginia, Rhode Island, and Carolina are
forming corps. Massachusetts Bay has long had
a sufficient number instructed to become instructive
of the rest. Even this Quakering province is
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
following the example.&hellip; In short, unless the
banditti at Westminster speedily undo everything
they have done, their royal paymaster will hear of
reviews and man&#339;uvres not quite so entertaining
as those he is presented with in Hyde Park and
Wimbledon Common.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor140" id="FNanchor140"></a><a href="#Footnote-140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> On the 1st of November,
a gentleman in Maryland wrote to a kinsman
in Glasgow: &#8220;The province of Virginia is raising
one company in every county.&hellip; This province
has taken the hint, and has begun to raise men in
every county also; and to the northward they have
large bodies, capable of acquitting themselves with
honor in the field.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor141" id="FNanchor141"></a><a href="#Footnote-141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> At about the same time,
the General Assembly of Connecticut ordered that
every town should at once supply itself with &#8220;double
the quantity of powder, balls, and flints&#8221; that
had been hitherto required by law.<a name="FNanchor142" id="FNanchor142"></a><a href="#Footnote-142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> On the 5th
of November, the officers of the Virginia troops
accompanying Lord Dunmore on his campaign
against the Indians held a meeting at Fort Gower,
on the Ohio River, and passed this resolution:
&#8220;That we will exert every power within us for the
defence of American liberty, and for the support
of her just rights and privileges, not in any precipitate,
riotous, or tumultuous manner, but when
regularly called forth by the unanimous voice of
our countrymen.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor143" id="FNanchor143"></a><a href="#Footnote-143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Not far from the same time,
the people of Rhode Island carried off to Providence
from the batteries at Newport forty-four
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
pieces of cannon; and the governor frankly told
the commander of a British naval force near at
hand that they had done this in order to prevent
these cannon from falling into his hands, and with
the purpose of using them against &#8220;any power that
might offer to molest the colony.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor144" id="FNanchor144"></a><a href="#Footnote-144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Early in
December, the Provincial Convention of Maryland
recommended that all persons between sixteen and
fifty years of age should form themselves into military
companies, and &#8220;be in readiness to act on any
emergency,&#8221;&mdash;with a sort of grim humor prefacing
their recommendation by this exquisite morsel
of argumentative irony:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;<i>Resolved</i> unanimously, that a well-regulated militia,
composed of the gentlemen freeholders and other freemen,
is the natural strength and only stable security of
a free government; and that such militia will relieve
our mother country from any expense in our protection
and defence, will obviate the pretence of a necessity for
taxing us on that account, and render it unnecessary to
keep any standing army&mdash;ever dangerous to liberty&mdash;in
this province.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor145" id="FNanchor145"></a><a href="#Footnote-145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The shrewdness of this courteous political thrust
on the part of the convention of Maryland seems
to have been so heartily relished by others that it
was thenceforward used again and again by similar
conventions elsewhere; and in fact, for the next
few months, these sentences became almost the
stereotyped formula by which revolutionary assemblages
justified the arming and drilling of the militia,&mdash;as,<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
for example, that of Newcastle County,
Delaware,<a name="FNanchor146" id="FNanchor146"></a><a href="#Footnote-146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> on the 21st of December; that of Fairfax
County, Virginia,<a name="FNanchor147" id="FNanchor147"></a><a href="#Footnote-147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> on the 17th of January,
1775; and that of Augusta County, Virginia,<a name="FNanchor148" id="FNanchor148"></a><a href="#Footnote-148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> on
the 22d of February.</p>

<p>In the mean time Lord Dunmore was not blind
to all these military preparations in Virginia;
and so early as the 24th of December, 1774, he
had written to the Earl of Dartmouth: &#8220;Every
county, besides, is now arming a company of men,
whom they call an independent company, for the
avowed purpose of protecting their committees,
and to be employed against government, if occasion
require.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor149" id="FNanchor149"></a><a href="#Footnote-149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Moreover, this alarming fact of
military preparation, which Lord Dunmore had
thus reported concerning Virginia, could have
been reported with equal truth concerning nearly
every other colony. In the early part of January,
1775, the Assembly of Connecticut gave order that
the entire militia of that colony should be mustered
every week.<a name="FNanchor150" id="FNanchor150"></a><a href="#Footnote-150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> In the latter part of January, the
provincial convention of Pennsylvania, though representing
a colony of Quakers, boldly proclaimed
that, if the administration &#8220;should determine by
force to effect a submission to the late arbitrary
acts of the British Parliament,&#8221; it would &#8220;resist
such force, and at every hazard &hellip; defend the
rights and liberties of America.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor151" id="FNanchor151"></a><a href="#Footnote-151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> On the 15th
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
of February, the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts
urged the people to &#8220;spare neither time,
pains, nor expense, at so critical a juncture, in
perfecting themselves forthwith in military discipline.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor152" id="FNanchor152"></a><a href="#Footnote-152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>When, therefore, so late as Monday, the 20th
of March, 1775, the second revolutionary convention
of Virginia assembled at Richmond, its members
were well aware that one of the chief measures
to come before them for consideration must be
that of recognizing the local military preparations
among their own constituents, and of placing them
all under some common organization and control.
Accordingly, on Thursday, the 23d of March, after
three days had been given to necessary preliminary
subjects, the inevitable subject of military preparations
was reached. Then it was that Patrick
Henry took the floor and moved the adoption of
the following resolutions, supporting his motion,
undoubtedly, with a speech:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;<i>Resolved</i>, That a well-regulated militia, composed
of gentlemen and yeomen, is the natural strength and
only security of a free government; that such a militia
in this colony would forever render it unnecessary for
the mother country to keep among us for the purpose
of our defence any standing army of mercenary forces,
always subversive of the quiet and dangerous to the liberties
of the people, and would obviate the pretext of
taxing us for their support.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Resolved</i>, That the establishment of such a militia
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
is at this time peculiarly necessary, by the state of our
laws for the protection and defence of the country, some
of which have already expired, and others will shortly
do so; and that the known remissness of government in
calling us together in a legislative capacity, renders it
too insecure, in this time of danger and distress, to rely
that opportunity will be given of renewing them in general
assembly, or making any provision to secure our
inestimable rights and liberties from those further violations
with which they are threatened.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Resolved, therefore</i>, That this colony be immediately
put into a posture of defence; and that &hellip; be a committee
to prepare a plan for the embodying, arming, and
disciplining such a number of men as may be sufficient
for that purpose.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor153" id="FNanchor153"></a><a href="#Footnote-153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>
</div>

<p>No one who reads these resolutions in the light
of the facts just given, can find in them anything
by which to account for the opposition which they
are known to have met with in that assemblage.
For that assemblage, it must be remembered, was
not the Virginia legislature: it was a mere convention,
and a revolutionary convention at that, gathered
in spite of the objections of Lord Dunmore,
representing simply the deliberate purpose of those
Virginians who meant not finally to submit to
unjust laws; some of its members, likewise, being
under express instructions from their constituents
to take measures for the immediate and adequate
military organization of the colony. Not a man,
probably, was sent to that convention, not a man
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
surely would have gone to it, who was not in substantial
sympathy with the prevailing revolutionary
spirit.</p>

<p>Of course, even they who were in sympathy with
that spirit might have objected to Patrick Henry&#8217;s
resolutions, had those resolutions been marked by
any startling novelty in doctrine, or by anything
extreme or violent in expression. But, plainly,
they were neither extreme nor violent; they were
not even novel. They contained nothing essential
which had not been approved, in almost the same
words, more than three months before, by similar
conventions in Maryland and in Delaware; which
had not been approved, in almost the same words,
many weeks before, by county conventions in Virginia,&mdash;in
one instance, by a county convention
presided over by Washington himself; which had
not been approved, in other language, either weeks
or months before, by Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and other colonies;
which was not sanctioned by the plainest prudence
on the part of all persons who intended to make
any further stand whatsoever against the encroachments
of Parliament. It is safe to say that no
man who had within him enough of the revolutionary
spirit to have prompted his attendance at a
revolutionary convention could have objected to
any essential item in Patrick Henry&#8217;s resolutions.</p>

<p>Why, then, were they objected to? Why was
their immediate passage resisted? The official
journal of the convention throws no light upon the
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
question: it records merely the adoption of the
resolutions, and is entirely silent respecting any
discussion that they may have provoked. Thirty
years afterward, however, St. George Tucker,
who, though not a member of this convention, had
yet as a visitor watched its proceedings that day,
gave from memory some account of them; and to
him we are indebted for the names of the principal
men who stood out against Patrick Henry&#8217;s motion.
&#8220;This produced,&#8221; he says, &#8220;an animated
debate, in which Colonel Richard Bland, Mr.
Nicholas, the treasurer, and I think Colonel Harrison,
of Berkeley, and Mr. Pendleton, were opposed
to the resolution, as conceiving it to be
premature;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor154" id="FNanchor154"></a><a href="#Footnote-154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> all these men being prudent politicians,
indeed, but all fully committed to the cause
of the Revolution.</p>

<p>At first, this testimony may seem to leave us as
much in the dark as before; and yet all who are
familiar with the politics of Virginia at that period
will see in this cluster of names some clew to the
secret of their opposition. It was an opposition to
Patrick Henry himself, and as far as possible to
any measure of which he should be the leading
champion. Yet even this is not enough. Whatever
may have been their private motives in resisting
a measure advocated by Patrick Henry, they
must still have had some reason which they would
be willing to assign. St. George Tucker tells us
that they conceived his resolutions to be &#8220;premature.&#8221;<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
But in themselves his resolutions, so far
from being premature, were rather tardy; they
lagged weeks and even months behind many of the
best counties in Virginia itself, as well as behind
those other colonies to which in political feeling
Virginia was always most nearly akin.</p>

<p>The only possible explanation of the case seems
to be found, not in the resolutions themselves, but
in the special interpretation put upon them by
Patrick Henry in the speech which, according to
parliamentary usage, he seems to have made in
moving their adoption. What was that interpretation?
In the true answer to that question, no
doubt, lies the secret of the resistance which his
motion encountered. For, down to that day, no
public body in America, and no public man, had
openly spoken of a war with Great Britain in any
more decisive way than as a thing highly probable,
indeed, but still not inevitable. At last Patrick
Henry spoke of it, and he wanted to induce the
convention of Virginia to speak of it, as a thing
inevitable. Others had said, &#8220;The war must come,
and will come,&mdash;unless certain things are done.&#8221;
Patrick Henry, brushing away every prefix or suffix
of uncertainty, every half-despairing &#8220;if,&#8221; every
fragile and pathetic &#8220;unless,&#8221; exclaimed, in the
hearing of all men: &#8220;Why talk of things being
now done which can avert the war? Such things
will not be done. The war is coming: it has come
already.&#8221; Accordingly, other conventions in the
colonies, in adopting similar resolutions, had merely
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
announced the probability of war. Patrick Henry
would have this convention, by adopting his resolutions,
virtually declare war itself.</p>

<p>In this alone, it is apparent, consisted the real
priority and offensiveness of Patrick Henry&#8217;s position
as a revolutionary statesman on the 23d of
March, 1775. In this alone were his resolutions
&#8220;premature.&#8221; The very men who opposed them
because they were to be understood as closing the
door against the possibility of peace, would have
favored them had they only left that door open, or
even ajar. But Patrick Henry demanded of the
people of Virginia that they should treat all further
talk of peace as mere prattle; that they should
seize the actual situation by a bold grasp of it in
front; that, looking upon the war as a fact, they
should instantly proceed to get ready for it. And
therein, once more, in revolutionary ideas, was
Patrick Henry one full step in advance of his contemporaries.
Therein, once more, did he justify
the reluctant praise of Jefferson, who was a member
of that convention, and who, nearly fifty years
afterward, said concerning Patrick Henry to a
great statesman from Massachusetts: &#8220;After all,
it must be allowed that he was our leader in the
measures of the Revolution in Virginia, and in that
respect more is due to him than to any other person.&hellip;
He left all of us far behind.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor155" id="FNanchor155"></a><a href="#Footnote-155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>Such, at any rate, we have a right to suppose,
was the substantial issue presented by the resolutions
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
of Patrick Henry, and by his introductory
speech in support of them; and upon this issue
the little group of politicians&mdash;able and patriotic
men, who always opposed his leadership&mdash;then
arrayed themselves against him, making the most,
doubtless, of everything favoring the possibility
and the desirableness of a peaceful adjustment of
the great dispute. But their opposition to him
only produced the usual result,&mdash;of arousing him
to an effort which simply overpowered and scattered
all further resistance. It was in review of their
whole quivering platoon of hopes and fears, of
doubts, cautions, and delays, that he then made
the speech which seems to have wrought astonishing
effects upon those who heard it, and which,
though preserved in a most inadequate report, now
fills so great a space in the traditions of revolutionary
eloquence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No man, Mr. President, thinks more highly than I
do of the patriotism, as well as the abilities, of the very
honorable gentlemen who have just addressed the House.
But different men often see the same subject in different
lights; and, therefore, I hope it will not be thought disrespectful
to those gentlemen if, entertaining, as I do,
opinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I should
speak forth my sentiments freely, and without reserve.
This is no time for ceremony. The question before the
house is one of awful moment to this country. For my
own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of
freedom or slavery. And in proportion to the magnitude
of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate.<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive
at truth, and fulfil the great responsibility which we
hold to God and our country. Should I keep back my
opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offence,
I should consider myself as guilty of treason towards
my country, and of an act of disloyalty towards the majesty
of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the
illusions of Hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against
a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren till
she transforms us into beasts. Is this the part of wise
men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?
Are we disposed to be of the number of those
who, having eyes, see not, and having ears, hear not,
the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation?
For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may
cost, I am willing to know the whole truth; to know
the worst, and to provide for it.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided,
and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no way
of judging of the future but by the past. And, judging
by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the
conduct of the British ministry, for the last ten years,
to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been
pleased to solace themselves and the House. Is it that
insidious smile with which our petition has been lately
received? Trust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to
your feet. Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a
kiss. Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of
our petition comports with those warlike preparations
which cover our waters and darken our land. Are fleets
and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation?
Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
reconciled, that force must be called in to win back our
love? Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the
implements of war and subjugation,&mdash;the last arguments
to which kings resort.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array,
if its purpose be not to force us to submission? Can
gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it? Has
Great Britain any enemy in this quarter of the world,
to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies?
No, sir, she has none. They are meant for us: they
can be meant for no other. They are sent over to bind
and rivet upon us those chains which the British ministry
have been so long forging.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And what have we to oppose to them? Shall we
try argument? Sir, we have been trying that for the
last ten years. Have we anything new to offer upon
the subject? Nothing. We have held the subject up
in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all
in vain. Shall we resort to entreaty, and humble supplication?
What terms shall we find which have not
been already exhausted?</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves
longer. Sir, we have done everything that could be
done to avert the storm which is now coming on. We
have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated;
we have prostrated ourselves before the throne,
and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical
hands of the ministry and Parliament. Our petitions
have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced
additional violence and insult; our supplications have
been disregarded; and we have been spurned with contempt
from the foot of the throne.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer
any room for hope. If we wish to be free; if we mean
to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for
which we have been so long contending; if we mean not
basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have
been so long engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves
never to abandon until the glorious object of our
contest shall be obtained,&mdash;we must fight! I repeat
it, sir,&mdash;we must fight! An appeal to arms, and to
the God of hosts, is all that is left us.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Up to this point in his address, the orator seems
to have spoken with great deliberation and self-restraint.
St. George Tucker, who was present,
and who has left a written statement of his recollections
both of the speech and of the scene, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;It was on that occasion that I first felt a full impression
of Mr. Henry&#8217;s powers. In vain should I
attempt to give any idea of his speech. He was calm
and collected; touched upon the origin and progress of
the dispute between Great Britain and the colonies, the
various conciliatory measures adopted by the latter, and
the uniformly increasing tone of violence and arrogance
on the part of the former.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Then follows, in Tucker&#8217;s narrative, the passage
included in the last two paragraphs of the speech
as given above, after which he adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;Imagine to yourself this speech delivered with all
the calm dignity of Cato of Utica; imagine to yourself
the Roman senate assembled in the capitol when it was
entered by the profane Gauls, who at first were awed
by their presence as if they had entered an assembly of
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
the gods; imagine that you heard that Cato addressing
such a senate; imagine that you saw the handwriting on
the wall of Belshazzar&#8217;s palace; imagine you heard a
voice as from heaven uttering the words, &#8216;We must
fight!&#8217; as the doom of fate,&mdash;and you may have some
idea of the speaker, the assembly to whom he addressed
himself, and the auditory of which I was one.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor156" id="FNanchor156"></a><a href="#Footnote-156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>
</div>

<p>But, by a comparison of this testimony of St.
George Tucker with that of others who heard the
speech, it is made evident that, as the orator then
advanced toward the conclusion and real climax of
his argument, he no longer maintained &#8220;the calm
dignity of Cato of Utica,&#8221; but that his manner
gradually deepened into an intensity of passion
and a dramatic power which were overwhelming.
He thus continued:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;&#8216;They tell us, sir, that we are weak,&mdash;unable to cope
with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we
be stronger? Will it be the next week, or the next
year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and
when a British guard shall be stationed in every house?
Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction?
Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by
lying supinely on our backs, and hugging the delusive
phantom of Hope, until our enemies shall have bound
us hand and foot?</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Sir, we are not weak, if we make a proper use of
those means which the God of nature hath placed in our
power. Three millions of people armed in the holy
cause of liberty, and in such a country as that which we
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy
can send against us.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone.
There is a just God who presides over the destinies of
nations, and who will raise up friends to fight our battles
for us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone: it is
to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides, sir, we
have no election. If we were base enough to desire it,
it is now too late to retire from the contest. There is
no retreat but in submission and slavery. Our chains
are forged. Their clanking may be heard on the plains
of Boston. The war is inevitable. And let it come! I
repeat it, sir, let it come!</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen
may cry peace, peace, but there is no peace. The
war is actually begun. The next gale that sweeps from
the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding
arms. Our brethren are already in the field. Why
stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish?
What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so
sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and
slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what
course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty,
or give me death!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Of this tremendous speech there are in existence
two traditional descriptions, neither of which is
inconsistent with the testimony given by St. George
Tucker. He, as a lawyer and a judge, seems to
have retained the impression of that portion of the
speech which was the more argumentative and unimpassioned:
the two other reporters seem to have
remembered especially its later and more emotional
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
passages. Our first traditional description was
obtained by Henry Stephens Randall from a
clergyman, who had it from an aged friend, also a
clergyman, who heard the speech itself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;Henry rose with an unearthly fire burning in his
eye. He commenced somewhat calmly, but the smothered
excitement began more and more to play upon his
features and thrill in the tones of his voice. The tendons
of his neck stood out white and rigid like whip-cords.
His voice rose louder and louder, until the walls
of the building, and all within them, seemed to shake
and rock in its tremendous vibrations. Finally, his pale
face and glaring eye became terrible to look upon. Men
leaned forward in their seats, with their heads strained
forward, their faces pale, and their eyes glaring like the
speaker&#8217;s. His last exclamation, &#8216;Give me liberty, or
give me death!&#8217; was like the shout of the leader which
turns back the rout of battle. The old man from whom
this tradition was derived added that, &#8216;when the orator
sat down, he himself felt sick with excitement. Every
eye yet gazed entranced on Henry. It seemed as if a
word from him would have led to any wild explosion of
violence. Men looked beside themselves.&#8217;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor157" id="FNanchor157"></a><a href="#Footnote-157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The second traditional description of the speech
is here given from a manuscript<a name="FNanchor158" id="FNanchor158"></a><a href="#Footnote-158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> of Edward Fontaine,
who obtained it in 1834 from John Roane,
who himself heard the speech. Roane told Fontaine
that the orator&#8217;s &#8220;voice, countenance, and
gestures gave an irresistible force to his words,<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
which no description could make intelligible to
one who had never seen him, nor heard him
speak;&#8221; but, in order to convey some notion of
the orator&#8217;s manner, Roane described the delivery
of the closing sentences of the speech:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;You remember, sir, the conclusion of the speech, so
often declaimed in various ways by school-boys,&mdash;&#8216;Is
life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the
price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God!
I know not what course others may take, but as for me,
give me liberty, or give me death!&#8217; He gave each of
these words a meaning which is not conveyed by the
reading or delivery of them in the ordinary way. When
he said, &#8216;Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased
at the price of chains and slavery?&#8217; he stood in
the attitude of a condemned galley slave, loaded with
fetters, awaiting his doom. His form was bowed; his
wrists were crossed; his manacles were almost visible as
he stood like an embodiment of helplessness and agony.
After a solemn pause, he raised his eyes and chained
hands towards heaven, and prayed, in words and tones
which thrilled every heart, &#8216;Forbid it, Almighty God!&#8217;
He then turned towards the timid loyalists of the House,
who were quaking with terror at the idea of the consequences
of participating in proceedings which would be
visited with the penalties of treason by the British crown;
and he slowly bent his form yet nearer to the earth, and
said, &#8216;I know not what course others may take,&#8217; and he
accompanied the words with his hands still crossed,
while he seemed to be weighed down with additional
chains. The man appeared transformed into an oppressed,
heart-broken, and hopeless felon. After remaining
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
in this posture of humiliation long enough to
impress the imagination with the condition of the colony
under the iron heel of military despotism, he arose
proudly, and exclaimed, &#8216;but as for me,&#8217;&mdash;and the
words hissed through his clenched teeth, while his body
was thrown back, and every muscle and tendon was
strained against the fetters which bound him, and, with
his countenance distorted by agony and rage, he looked
for a moment like Laoco&ouml;n in a death struggle with
coiling serpents; then the loud, clear, triumphant notes,
&#8216;Give me liberty,&#8217; electrified the assembly. It was not
a prayer, but a stern demand, which would submit to no
refusal or delay. The sound of his voice, as he spoke
these memorable words, was like that of a Spartan p&aelig;an
on the field of Plat&aelig;a; and, as each syllable of the word
&#8216;liberty&#8217; echoed through the building, his fetters were
shivered; his arms were hurled apart; and the links of
his chains were scattered to the winds. When he spoke
the word &#8216;liberty&#8217; with an emphasis never given it before,
his hands were open, and his arms elevated and extended;
his countenance was radiant; he stood erect and
defiant; while the sound of his voice and the sublimity of
his attitude made him appear a magnificent incarnation
of Freedom, and expressed all that can be acquired or
enjoyed by nations and individuals invincible and free.
After a momentary pause, only long enough to permit
the echo of the word &#8216;liberty&#8217; to cease, he let his left
hand fall powerless to his side, and clenched his right
hand firmly, as if holding a dagger with the point aimed
at his breast. He stood like a Roman senator defying
C&aelig;sar, while the unconquerable spirit of Cato of Utica
flashed from every feature; and he closed the grand
appeal with the solemn words, &#8216;or give me death!&#8217; which
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
sounded with the awful cadence of a hero&#8217;s dirge, fearless
of death, and victorious in death; and he suited the
action to the word by a blow upon the left breast with
the right hand, which seemed to drive the dagger to the
patriot&#8217;s heart.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor159" id="FNanchor159"></a><a href="#Footnote-159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Before passing from this celebrated speech, it
is proper to say something respecting the authenticity
of the version of it which has come down to
us, and which is now so universally known in
America. The speech is given in these pages substantially
as it was given by Wirt in his &#8220;Life of
Henry.&#8221; Wirt himself does not mention whence
he obtained his version; and all efforts to discover
that version as a whole, in any writing prior to
Wirt&#8217;s book, have thus far been unsuccessful.
These facts have led even so genial a critic as
Grigsby to incline to the opinion that &#8220;much of
the speech published by Wirt is apocryphal.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor160" id="FNanchor160"></a><a href="#Footnote-160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
It would, indeed, be an odd thing, and a source
of no little disturbance to many minds, if such
should turn out to be the case, and if we should
have to conclude that an apocryphal speech written
by Wirt, and attributed by him to Patrick
Henry fifteen years after the great orator&#8217;s death,
had done more to perpetuate the renown of Patrick
Henry&#8217;s oratory than had been done by any
and all the words actually spoken by the orator
himself during his lifetime. On the other hand,
it should be said that Grigsby himself admits that
&#8220;the outline of the argument&#8221; and &#8220;some of its
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
expressions&#8221; are undoubtedly &#8220;authentic.&#8221; That
this is so is apparent, likewise, from the written
recollections of St. George Tucker, wherein the
substance of the speech is given, besides one entire
passage in almost the exact language of the version
by Wirt. Finally, John Roane, in 1834, in
his conversation with Edward Fontaine, is said
to have &#8220;verified the correctness of the speech as
it was written by Judge Tyler for Mr. Wirt.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor161" id="FNanchor161"></a><a href="#Footnote-161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
This, unfortunately, is the only intimation that
has anywhere been found attributing Wirt&#8217;s version
to the excellent authority of Judge John
Tyler. If the statement could be confirmed, it
would dispel every difficulty at once. But, even
though the statement should be set aside, enough
would still remain to justify us in thinking that
Wirt&#8217;s version of the famous speech by no means
deserves to be called &#8220;apocryphal,&#8221; in any such
sense as that word has when applied, for example,
to the speeches in Livy and in Thucydides, or in
Botta. In the first place, Wirt&#8217;s version certainly
gives the substance of the speech as actually made
by Patrick Henry on the occasion named; and,
for the form of it, Wirt seems to have gathered
testimony from all available living witnesses, and
then, from such sentences or snatches of sentences
as these witnesses could remember, as well as from
his own conception of the orator&#8217;s method of expression,
to have constructed the version which he
has handed down to us. Even in that case, it is
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
probably far more accurate and authentic than are
most of the famous speeches attributed to public
characters before reporters&#8217; galleries were opened,
and before the art of reporting was brought to its
present perfection.</p>

<p>Returning, now, from this long account of Patrick
Henry&#8217;s most celebrated speech, to the assemblage
in which it was made, it remains to be mentioned
that the resolutions, as offered by Patrick
Henry, were carried; and that the committee,
called for by those resolutions, to prepare a plan
for &#8220;embodying, arming, and disciplining&#8221; the
militia,<a name="FNanchor162" id="FNanchor162"></a><a href="#Footnote-162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> was at once appointed. Of this committee
Patrick Henry was chairman; and with him
were associated Richard Henry Lee, Nicholas,
Harrison, Riddick, Washington, Stephen, Lewis,
Christian, Pendleton, Jefferson, and Zane. On
the following day, Friday, the 24th of March, the
committee brought in its report, which was laid
over for one day, and then, after some amendment,
was unanimously adopted.</p>

<p>The convention did not close its labors until
Monday, the 27th of March. The contemporaneous
estimate of Patrick Henry, not merely as a
leader in debate, but as a constitutional lawyer,
and as a man of affairs, may be partly gathered
from the fact of his connection with each of the
two other important committees of this convention,&mdash;the
committee &#8220;to inquire whether his majesty
may of right advance the terms of granting lands
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
in this colony,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor163" id="FNanchor163"></a><a href="#Footnote-163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> on which his associates were the
great lawyers, Bland, Jefferson, Nicholas, and
Pendleton; and the committee &#8220;to prepare a plan
for the encouragement of arts and manufactures
in this colony,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor164" id="FNanchor164"></a><a href="#Footnote-164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> on which his associates were
Nicholas, Bland, Mercer, Pendleton, Cary, Carter
of Stafford, Harrison, Richard Henry Lee, Clapham,
Washington, Holt, and Newton.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X <br />
<span class="hsub">THE RAPE OF THE GUNPOWDER</span></h2>


<p>Several of the famous men of the Revolution,
whose distinction is now exclusively that of civilians,
are supposed to have cherished very decided
military aspirations; to have been rather envious
of the more vivid renown acquired by some of
their political associates who left the senate for
the field; and, indeed, to have made occasional
efforts to secure for themselves the opportunity
for glory in the same pungent and fascinating
form. A notable example of this class of Revolutionary
civilians with abortive military desires, is
John Hancock. In June, 1775, when Congress
had before it the task of selecting one who should
be the military leader of the uprisen colonists,
John Hancock, seated in the president&#8217;s chair,
gave unmistakable signs of thinking that the choice
ought to fall upon himself. While John Adams
was speaking in general terms of the military situation,
involving, of course, the need of a commander-in-chief,
Hancock heard him &#8220;with visible
pleasure;&#8221; but when the orator came to point out
Washington as the man best fitted for the leadership,
&#8220;a sudden and striking change&#8221; came over
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the countenance of the president. &#8220;Mortification
and resentment were expressed as forcibly as his
face could exhibit them;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor165" id="FNanchor165"></a><a href="#Footnote-165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> and it is probable that,
to the end of his days, he was never able entirely
to forgive Washington for having carried off the
martial glory that he had really believed to be
within his own reach. But even John Adams,
who so pitilessly unveiled the baffled military desires
of Hancock, was perhaps not altogether unacquainted
with similar emotions in his own soul.
Fully three weeks prior to that notable scene in
Congress, in a letter to his wife in which he was
speaking of the amazing military spirit then running
through the continent, and of the military
appointments then held by several of his Philadelphia
friends, he exclaimed in his impulsive way,
&#8220;Oh that I were a soldier! I will be.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor166" id="FNanchor166"></a><a href="#Footnote-166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> And on
the very day on which he joined in the escort of
the new generals, Washington, Lee, and Schuyler,
on their first departure from Philadelphia for the
American camp, he sent off to his wife a characteristic
letter revealing something of the anguish
with which he, a civilian, viewed the possibility
of his being at a disadvantage with these military
men in the race for glory:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The three generals were all mounted on horseback,
accompanied by Major Mifflin, who is gone in the character
of aide-de-camp. All the delegates from the Massachusetts,
with their servants and carriages, attended.
Many others of the delegates from the Congress; a large
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
troop of light horse in their uniforms; many officers of
militia, besides, in theirs; music playing, etc., etc. Such
is the pride and pomp of war. I, poor creature, worn
out with scribbling for my bread and my liberty, low in
spirits and weak in health, must leave to others to wear
the laurels which I have sown; others to eat the bread
which I have earned.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor167" id="FNanchor167"></a><a href="#Footnote-167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Of Patrick Henry, however, it may be said that
his permanent fame as an orator and a statesman
has almost effaced the memory of the fact that,
in the first year of the war, he had considerable
prominence as a soldier; that it was then believed
by many, and very likely by himself, that, having
done as much as any man to bring on the war, he
was next to do as much as any man in the actual
conduct of it, and was thus destined to add to a
civil renown of almost unapproached brilliance, a
similar renown for splendid talents in the field.
At any rate, the &#8220;first overt act of war&#8221; in Virginia,
as Jefferson testifies,<a name="FNanchor168" id="FNanchor168"></a><a href="#Footnote-168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> was committed by
Patrick Henry. The first physical resistance to
a royal governor, which in Massachusetts was made
by the embattled farmers at Lexington and Concord,
was made in Virginia almost as early, under
the direction and inspiration of Patrick Henry&#8217;s
leadership. In the first organization of the Revolutionary
army in Virginia, the chief command
was given to Patrick Henry. Finally, that he
never had the opportunity of proving in battle
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
whether or not he had military talents, and that,
after some months of nominal command, he was
driven by a series of official slights into an abandonment
of his military career, may have been
occasioned solely by a proper distrust of his military
capacity on the part of the Virginia Committee
of Safety, or it may have been due in some measure
to the unslumbering jealousy of him which
was at the time attributed to the leading members
of that committee. The purpose of this chapter,
and of the next, will be to present a rapid grouping
of these incidents in his life,&mdash;incidents which
now have the appearance of a mere episode, but
which once seemed the possible beginnings of a
deliberate and conspicuous military career.</p>

<p>Within the city of Williamsburg, at the period
now spoken of, had long been kept the public
storehouse for gunpowder and arms. In the dead
of the night<a name="FNanchor169" id="FNanchor169"></a><a href="#Footnote-169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> preceding the 21st of April, 1775,&mdash;a
little less than a month, therefore, after the
convention of Virginia had proclaimed the inevitable
approach of a war with Great Britain,&mdash;a
detachment of marines from the armed schooner
Magdalen, then lying in the James River, stealthily
visited this storehouse, and, taking thence fifteen
half-barrels of gunpowder,<a name="FNanchor170" id="FNanchor170"></a><a href="#Footnote-170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> carried them off
in Lord Dunmore&#8217;s wagon to Burwell&#8217;s Ferry,
and put them on board their vessel. Of course,
the news of this exploit flew fast through the colony,
and everywhere awoke alarm and exasperation.<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Soon some thousands of armed men made
ready to march to the capital to demand the restoration
of the gunpowder. On Tuesday, the 25th
of April, the independent company of Fredericksburg
notified their colonel, George Washington,
that, with his approbation, they would be prepared
to start for Williamsburg on the following Saturday,
&#8220;properly accoutred as light-horsemen,&#8221; and
in conjunction with &#8220;any other bodies of armed
men who&#8221; might be &#8220;willing to appear in support
of the honor of Virginia.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor171" id="FNanchor171"></a><a href="#Footnote-171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>Similar messages were promptly sent to Washington
from the independent companies of Prince
William<a name="FNanchor172" id="FNanchor172"></a><a href="#Footnote-172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
and Albemarle counties.<a name="FNanchor173" id="FNanchor173"></a><a href="#Footnote-173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
On Wednesday,
the 26th of April, the men in arms who
had already arrived at Fredericksburg sent to the
capital a swift messenger &#8220;to inquire whether the
gunpowder had been replaced in the public magazine.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor174" id="FNanchor174"></a><a href="#Footnote-174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
On Saturday, the 29th,&mdash;being the day
already fixed for the march upon Williamsburg,&mdash;one
hundred and two gentlemen, representing
fourteen companies of light-horse, met in council
at Fredericksburg, and, after considering a letter
from the venerable Peyton Randolph which their
messenger had brought back with him, particularly
Randolph&#8217;s assurance that the affair of the gunpowder
was to be satisfactorily arranged, came to
the resolution that they would proceed no further
at that time; adding, however, this solemn declaration:
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
&#8220;We do now pledge ourselves to each other
to be in readiness, at a moment&#8217;s warning, to reassemble,
and by force of arms to defend the law,
the liberty, and rights of this or any sister colony
from unjust and wicked invasion.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor175" id="FNanchor175"></a><a href="#Footnote-175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>It is at this point that Patrick Henry comes
upon the scene. Thus far, during the trouble, he
appears to have been watching events from his
home in Hanover County. As soon, however, as
word was brought to him of the tame conclusion
thus reached by the assembled warriors at Fredericksburg,
his soul took fire at the lamentable mistake
which he thought they had made. To him it
seemed on every account the part of wisdom that
the blow, which would have to be &#8220;struck sooner
or later, should be struck at once, before an overwhelming
force should enter the colony;&#8221; that the
spell by which the people were held in a sort of
superstitious awe of the governor should be broken;
&#8220;that the military resources of the country should
be developed;&#8221; that the people should be made to
&#8220;see and feel their strength by being brought out
together; that the revolution should be set in actual
motion in the colony; that the martial prowess
of the country should be awakened, and the soldiery
animated by that proud and resolute confidence
which a successful enterprise in the commencement
of a contest never fails to inspire.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor176" id="FNanchor176"></a><a href="#Footnote-176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p><span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Accordingly, he resolved that, as the troops
lately rendezvoused at Fredericksburg had forborne
to strike this needful blow, he would endeavor to
repair the mistake by striking it himself. At
once, therefore, he despatched expresses to the
officers and men of the independent company of
his own county, &#8220;requesting them to meet him in
arms at New Castle on the second of May, on
business of the highest importance to American
liberty.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor177" id="FNanchor177"></a><a href="#Footnote-177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
He also summoned the county committee
to meet him at the same time and place.</p>

<p>At the place and time appointed his neighbors
were duly assembled; and when he had laid before
them, in a speech of wonderful eloquence, his view
of the situation, they instantly resolved to put
themselves under his command, and to march at
once to the capital, either to recover the gunpowder
itself, or to make reprisals on the king&#8217;s property
sufficient to replace it. Without delay the march
began, Captain Patrick Henry leading. By sunset
of the following day, they had got as far as to
Doncastle&#8217;s Ordinary, about sixteen miles from
Williamsburg, and there rested for the night.
Meantime, the news that Patrick Henry was
marching with armed men straight against Lord
Dunmore, to demand the restoration of the gunpowder
or payment for it, carried exhilaration or
terror in all directions. On the one hand, many
prudent and conservative gentlemen were horrified
at his rashness, and sent messenger after messenger
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
to beg him to stay his fearful proceeding, to
turn about, and to go home.<a name="FNanchor178" id="FNanchor178"></a><a href="#Footnote-178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> On the other hand,
as the word flew from county to county that Patrick
Henry had taken up the people&#8217;s cause in
this vigorous fashion, five thousand men sprang to
arms, and started across the country to join the
ranks of his followers, and to lend a hand in case
of need. At Williamsburg, the rumor of his approach
brought on a scene of consternation. The
wife and family of Lord Dunmore were hurried
away to a place of safety. Further down the
river, the commander of his majesty&#8217;s ship Fowey
was notified that &#8220;his excellency the Lord Dunmore,
governor of Virginia,&#8221; was &#8220;threatened
with an attack at daybreak, &hellip; at his palace at
Williamsburg;&#8221; and for his defence was speedily
sent off a detachment of marines.<a name="FNanchor179" id="FNanchor179"></a><a href="#Footnote-179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Before daybreak,
however, the governor seems to have come
to the prudent decision to avert, by a timely settlement
with Patrick Henry, the impending attack;
and accordingly, soon after daybreak, a messenger
arrived at Doncastle&#8217;s Ordinary, there to tender
immediate satisfaction in money for the gunpowder
that had been ravished away.<a name="FNanchor180" id="FNanchor180"></a><a href="#Footnote-180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> The troops, having
already resumed their march, were halted; and
soon a settlement of the trouble was effected, according
to the terms of the following singular
document:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Doncastle&#8217;s Ordinary, New Kent</span>, May 4, 1775.</p>

<p>Received from the Honorable Richard Corbin, Esq.,
his majesty&#8217;s receiver-general, &pound;330, as a compensation
for the gunpowder lately taken out of the public magazine
by the governor&#8217;s order; which money I promise to
convey to the Virginia delegates at the General Congress,
to be under their direction laid out in gunpowder for
the colony&#8217;s use, and to be stored as they shall direct,
until the next colony convention or General Assembly;
unless it shall be necessary, in the mean time, to use the
same in defence of this colony. It is agreed, that in
case the next convention shall determine that any part
of the said money ought to be returned to his majesty&#8217;s
receiver-general, that the same shall be done accordingly.</p>

<p class="right1"><span class="smcap">Patrick Henry, Junior.</span><a name="FNanchor181" id="FNanchor181"></a><a href="#Footnote-181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The chief object for which Patrick Henry and
his soldiers had taken the trouble to come to that
place having been thus suddenly accomplished,
there was but one thing left for them to do before
they should return to their homes. Robert Carter
Nicholas, the treasurer of the colony, was at
Williamsburg; and to him Patrick Henry at once
despatched a letter informing him of the arrangement
that had been made, and offering to him any
protection that he might in consequence require:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right1">May 4, 1775.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;The affair of the powder is now settled, so as
to produce satisfaction in me, and I earnestly wish to
the colony in general. The people here have it in charge
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
from the Hanover committee, to tender their services to
you as a public officer, for the purpose of escorting the
public treasury to any place in this colony where the
money would be judged more safe than in the city of
Williamsburg. The reprisal now made by the Hanover
volunteers, though accomplished in a manner least liable
to the imputation of violent extremity, may possibly be
the cause of future injury to the treasury. If, therefore,
you apprehend the least danger, a sufficient guard
is at your service. I beg the return of the bearer may
be instant, because the men wish to know their destination.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="right6">With great regard, I am, sir,</span><br />
<span class="right3">Your most humble servant,</span><br />
<span class="right1 smcap">Patrick Henry, Junior.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Robert Carter Nicholas</span>, Esq., Treasurer.<a name="FNanchor182" id="FNanchor182"></a><a href="#Footnote-182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Patrick Henry&#8217;s desire for an immediate answer
from the respectable Mr. Nicholas was gratified,
although it came in the form of a dignified rebuff:
Mr. Nicholas &#8220;had no apprehension of the necessity
or propriety of the proffered service.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor183" id="FNanchor183"></a><a href="#Footnote-183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>No direct communication seems to have been
had at that time with Lord Dunmore; but two
days afterward his lordship, having given to Patrick
Henry ample time to withdraw to a more
agreeable distance, sent thundering after him this
portentous proclamation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Whereas I have been informed from undoubted authority
that a certain Patrick Henry, of the county of
Hanover, and a number of deluded followers, have taken
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
up arms, chosen their officers, and styling themselves an
independent company, have marched out of their county,
encamped, and put themselves in a posture of war, and
have written and dispatched letters to divers parts of
the country, exciting the people to join in these outrageous
and rebellious practices, to the great terror of all
his majesty&#8217;s faithful subjects, and in open defiance of
law and government; and have committed other acts of
violence, particularly in extorting from his majesty&#8217;s
receiver-general the sum of three hundred and thirty
pounds, under pretence of replacing the powder I thought
proper to order from the magazine; whence it undeniably
appears that there is no longer the least security
for the life or property of any man: wherefore, I have
thought proper, with the advice of his majesty&#8217;s council,
and in his majesty&#8217;s name, to issue this my proclamation,
strictly charging all persons, upon their allegiance,
not to aid, abet, or give countenance to the said Patrick
Henry, or any other persons concerned in such unwarrantable
combinations, but on the contrary to oppose
them and their designs by every means; which designs
must, otherwise, inevitably involve the whole country in
the most direful calamity, as they will call for the vengeance
of offended majesty and the insulted laws to be
exerted here, to vindicate the constitutional authority of
government.</p>

<p>Given under my hand and the seal of the colony, at
Williamsburg, this 6th day of May, 1775, and in the
fifteenth year of his majesty&#8217;s reign.</p>

<p class="right1 smcap">Dunmore.</p>

<p>God save the king.<a name="FNanchor184" id="FNanchor184"></a><a href="#Footnote-184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>
</div>


<p><span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
Beyond question, there were in Virginia at that
time many excellent gentlemen who still trusted
that the dispute with Great Britain might be composed
without bloodshed, and to whom Patrick
Henry&#8217;s conduct in this affair must have appeared
foolhardy, presumptuous, and even criminal. The
mass of the people of Virginia, however, did not
incline to take that view of the subject. They
had no faith any longer in timid counsels, in hesitating
measures. They believed that their most
important earthly rights were in danger. They
longed for a leader with vigor, promptitude, courage,
caring less for technical propriety than for
justice, and not afraid to say so, by word or deed,
to Lord Dunmore and to Lord Dunmore&#8217;s master.
Such a leader they thought they saw in Patrick
Henry. Accordingly, even on his march homeward
from Doncastle&#8217;s Ordinary, the heart of Virginia
began to go forth to him in expressions of
love, of gratitude, and of homage, such as no
American colonist perhaps had ever before received.
Upon his return home, his own county
greeted him with its official approval.<a name="FNanchor185" id="FNanchor185"></a><a href="#Footnote-185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> On the 8th
of May, the county of Louisa sent him her thanks;<a name="FNanchor186" id="FNanchor186"></a><a href="#Footnote-186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
and on the following day, messages to the same
effect were sent from the counties of Orange and
Spottsylvania.<a name="FNanchor187" id="FNanchor187"></a><a href="#Footnote-187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> On the 19th of May, an address
&#8220;to the inhabitants of Virginia,&#8221; under the signature
of &#8220;Brutus,&#8221; saluted Patrick Henry as &#8220;his
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
country&#8217;s and America&#8217;s unalterable and unappalled
great advocate and friend.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor188" id="FNanchor188"></a><a href="#Footnote-188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> On the 22d
of May, Prince William County declared its thanks
to be &#8220;justly due to Captain Patrick Henry, and
the gentlemen volunteers who attended him, for
their proper and spirited conduct.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor189" id="FNanchor189"></a><a href="#Footnote-189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> On the 26th
of May, Loudoun County declared its cordial
approval.<a name="FNanchor190" id="FNanchor190"></a><a href="#Footnote-190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> On the 9th of June, the volunteer
company of Lancaster County resolved &#8220;that every
member of this company do return thanks to the
worthy Captain Patrick Henry and the volunteer
company of Hanover, for their spirited conduct on
a late expedition, and they are determined to protect
him from any insult that may be offered him,
on that account, at the risk of life and fortune.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor191" id="FNanchor191"></a><a href="#Footnote-191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
On the 19th of June, resolutions of gratitude and
confidence were voted by the counties of Prince
Edward and of Frederick, the latter saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;We should blush to be thus late in our commendations
of, and thanks to, Patrick Henry, Esquire, for his
patriotic and spirited behavior in making reprisals for
the powder so unconstitutionally &hellip; taken from the
public magazine, could we have entertained a thought
that any part of the colony would have condemned a
measure calculated for the benefit of the whole; but as
we are informed this is the case, we beg leave &hellip;
to assure that gentleman that we did from the first, and
still do, most cordially approve and commend his conduct
in that affair. The good people of this county will
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
never fail to approve and support him to the utmost of
their powers in every action derived from so rich a
source as the love of his country. We heartily thank
him for stepping forth to convince the tools of despotism
that freeborn men are not to be intimidated, by any
form of danger, to submit to the arbitrary acts of their
rulers.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor192" id="FNanchor192"></a><a href="#Footnote-192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>
</div>

<p>On the 10th of July, the county of Fincastle prolonged
the strain of public affection and applause
by assuring Patrick Henry that it would support
and justify him at the risk of life and fortune.<a name="FNanchor193" id="FNanchor193"></a><a href="#Footnote-193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>In the mean time, the second Continental Congress
had already convened at Philadelphia, beginning
its work on the 10th of May. The journal
mentions the presence, on that day, of all the delegates
from Virginia, excepting Patrick Henry,
who, of course, had been delayed in his preparations
for the journey by the events which we have
just described. Not until the 11th of May was he
able to set out from his home; and he was then
accompanied upon his journey, to a point beyond
the borders of the colony, by a spontaneous escort
of armed men,&mdash;a token, not only of the popular
love for him, but of the popular anxiety lest Dunmore
should take the occasion of an unprotected
journey to put him under arrest. &#8220;Yesterday,&#8221;<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
says a document dated at Hanover, May the 12th,
1775, &#8220;Patrick Henry, one of the delegates for
this colony, escorted by a number of respectable
young gentlemen, volunteers from this and King
William and Caroline counties, set out to attend
the General Congress. They proceeded with him
as far as Mrs. Hooe&#8217;s ferry, on the Potomac, by
whom they were most kindly and hospitably entertained,
and also provided with boats and hands to
cross the river; and after partaking of this lady&#8217;s
beneficence, the bulk of the company took their
leave of Mr. Henry, saluting him with two platoons
and repeated huzzas. A guard accompanied
that worthy gentleman to the Maryland side, who
saw him safely landed; and committing him to
the gracious and wise Disposer of all human events,
to guide and protect him whilst contending for a
restitution of our dearest rights and liberties, they
wished him a safe journey, and happy return to
his family and friends.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor194" id="FNanchor194"></a><a href="#Footnote-194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI <br />
<span class="hsub">IN CONGRESS AND IN CAMP</span></h2>


<p>On Thursday, the 18th of May, Patrick Henry
took his seat in the second Continental Congress;
and he appears thenceforward to have continued
in attendance until the very end of the session,
which occurred on the 1st of August. From the
official journal of this Congress, it is impossible
to ascertain the full extent of any member&#8217;s participation
in its work. Its proceedings were transacted
in secret; and only such results were announced
to the public as, in the opinion of Congress,
it was desirable that the public should know. Then,
too, from the private correspondence and the diaries
of its members but little help can be got. As
affecting Patrick Henry, almost the only non-official
testimony that has been found is that of Jefferson,
who, however, did not enter this Congress
until its session was half gone, and who, forty
years afterward, wrote what he probably supposed
to be his recollections concerning his old friend&#8217;s
deportment and influence in that body:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;I found Mr. Henry to be a silent and almost unmeddling
member in Congress. On the original opening of
that body, while general grievances were the topic, he
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
was in his element, and captivated all by his bold and
splendid eloquence. But as soon as they came to specific
matters, to sober reasoning and solid argumentation,
he had the good sense to perceive that his declamation,
however excellent in its proper place, had no weight
at all in such an assembly as that, of cool-headed, reflecting,
judicious men. He ceased, therefore, in a great
measure, to take any part in the business. He seemed,
indeed, very tired of the place, and wonderfully relieved
when, by appointment of the Virginia convention to be
colonel of their first regiment, he was permitted to leave
Congress about the last of July.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor195" id="FNanchor195"></a><a href="#Footnote-195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the principal value of this testimony is
to serve as an illustration of the extreme fragility
of any man&#8217;s memory respecting events long passed,
even in his own experience. Thus, Jefferson here
remembers how &#8220;wonderfully relieved&#8221; Patrick
Henry was at being &#8220;permitted to leave Congress&#8221;
on account of his appointment by the Virginia
convention &#8220;to be colonel of their first regiment.&#8221;
But, from the official records of the time, it can
now be shown that neither of the things which
Jefferson thus remembers, ever had any existence
in fact. In the first place, the journal of the Virginia
convention<a name="FNanchor196" id="FNanchor196"></a><a href="#Footnote-196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> indicates that Patrick Henry&#8217;s
appointment as colonel could not have been the
occasion of any such relief from congressional duties
as Jefferson speaks of; for that appointment
was not made until five days after Congress itself
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
had adjourned, when, of course, Patrick Henry
and his fellow delegates, including Jefferson, were
already far advanced on their journey back to Virginia.
In the second place, the journal of Congress<a name="FNanchor197" id="FNanchor197"></a><a href="#Footnote-197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
indicates that Patrick Henry had no such
relief from congressional duties, on any account,
but was bearing his full share in its business, even
in the plainest and most practical details, down to
the very end of the session.</p>

<p>Any one who now recalls the tremendous events
that were taking place in the land while the second
Continental Congress was in session, and the immense
questions of policy and of administration
with which it had to deal, will find it hard to believe
that its deliberations were out of the range
of Patrick Henry&#8217;s sympathies or capacities, or
that he could have been the listless, speechless,
and ineffective member depicted by the later pen
of Jefferson. When that Congress first came together,
the blood was as yet hardly dry on the
grass in Lexington Common; on the very morning
on which its session opened, the colonial troops
burst into the stronghold at Ticonderoga; and
when the session had lasted but six weeks, its
members were conferring together over the ghastly
news from Bunker Hill. The organization of some
kind of national government for thirteen colonies
precipitated into a state of war; the creation of a
national army; the selection of a commander-in-chief,
and of the officers to serve under him; the
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
hurried fortification of coasts, harbors, cities; the
supply of the troops with clothes, tents, weapons,
ammunition, food, medicine; protection against
the Indian tribes along the frontier of nearly every
colony; the goodwill of the people of Canada, and
of Jamaica; a solemn, final appeal to the king
and to the people of England; an appeal to the
people of Ireland; finally, a grave statement to all
mankind of &#8220;the causes and necessity of their
taking up arms,&#8221;&mdash;these were among the weighty
and soul-stirring matters which the second Continental
Congress had to consider and to decide
upon. For any man to say, forty years afterward,
even though he say it with all the authority of the
renown of Thomas Jefferson, that, in the presence
of such questions, the spirit of Patrick Henry was
dull or unconcerned, and that, in a Congress which
had to deal with such questions, he was &#8220;a silent
and almost unmeddling member,&#8221; is to put a strain
upon human confidence which it is unable to bear.</p>

<p>The formula by which the daily labors of this
Congress are frequently described in its own journal
is, that &#8220;Congress met according to adjournment,
and, agreeable to the order of the day, again
resolved itself into a committee of the whole to
take into consideration the state of America; and
after some time spent therein, the president resumed
the chair, and Mr. Ward, from the committee,
reported that they had proceeded in the
business, but, not having completed it, desired
him to move for leave to sit again.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor198" id="FNanchor198"></a><a href="#Footnote-198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> And although,<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
from the beginning to the end of the session,
no mention is made of any word spoken in
debate by any member, we can yet glean, even
from that meagre record, enough to prove that
upon Patrick Henry was laid about as much labor
in the form of committee-work as upon any other
member of the House,&mdash;a fair test, it is believed,
of any man&#8217;s zeal, industry, and influence in any
legislative body.</p>

<p>Further, it will be noted that the committee-work
to which he was thus assigned was often of
the homeliest and most prosaic kind, calling not
for declamatory gifts, but for common sense, discrimination,
experience, and knowledge of men
and things. He seems, also, to have had special
interest and authority in the several anxious phases
of the Indian question as presented by the exigencies
of that awful crisis, and to have been placed
on every committee that was appointed to deal
with any branch of the subject. Thus, on the
16th of June, he was placed with General Schuyler,
James Duane, James Wilson, and Philip
Livingston, on a committee &#8220;to take into consideration
the papers transmitted from the convention
of New York, relative to Indian affairs, and report
what steps, in their opinion, are necessary to
be taken for securing and preserving the friendship
of the Indian nations.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor199" id="FNanchor199"></a><a href="#Footnote-199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> On the 19th of
June, he served with John Adams and Thomas
Lynch on a committee to inform Charles Lee of
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
his appointment as second major-general; and when
Lee&#8217;s answer imported that his situation and circumstances
as a British officer required some further
and very careful negotiations with Congress,
Patrick Henry was placed upon the special committee
to which this delicate business was intrusted.<a name="FNanchor200" id="FNanchor200"></a><a href="#Footnote-200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
On the 21st of June, the very day on which, according
to the journal, &#8220;Mr. Thomas Jefferson
appeared as a delegate for the colony of Virginia,
and produced his credentials,&#8221; his colleague, Patrick
Henry, rose in his place and stated that Washington
&#8220;had put into his hand sundry queries, to
which he desired the Congress would give an answer.&#8221;
These queries necessarily involved subjects
of serious concern to the cause for which they were
about to plunge into war, and would certainly require
for their consideration &#8220;cool-headed, reflecting,
and judicious men.&#8221; The committee appointed
for the purpose consisted of Silas Deane, Patrick
Henry, John Rutledge, Samuel Adams, and Richard
Henry Lee.<a name="FNanchor201" id="FNanchor201"></a><a href="#Footnote-201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
On the 10th of July, &#8220;Mr.
Alsop informed the Congress that he had an invoice
of Indian goods, which a gentleman in this
town had delivered to him, and which the said
gentleman was willing to dispose of to the Congress.&#8221;
The committee &#8220;to examine the said invoice
and report to the Congress&#8221; was composed
of Philip Livingston, Patrick Henry, and John
Alsop.<a name="FNanchor202" id="FNanchor202"></a><a href="#Footnote-202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
On the 12th of July, it was resolved to
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
organize three departments for the management of
Indian affairs, the commissioners to &#8220;have power
to treat with the Indians in their respective departments,
in the name and on behalf of the United
Colonies, in order to preserve peace and friendship
with the said Indians, and to prevent their taking
any part in the present commotions.&#8221; On the
following day the commissioners for the middle
department were elected, namely, Franklin, Patrick
Henry, and James Wilson.<a name="FNanchor203" id="FNanchor203"></a><a href="#Footnote-203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> On the 17th of
July, a committee was appointed to negotiate with
the Indian missionary, the Rev. Samuel Kirkland,
respecting his past and future services among the
Six Nations, &#8220;in order to secure their friendship,
and to continue them in a state of neutrality with
respect to the present controversy between Great
Britain and these colonies.&#8221; This committee consisted
of Thomas Cushing, Patrick Henry, and
Silas Deane.<a name="FNanchor204" id="FNanchor204"></a><a href="#Footnote-204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Finally, on the 31st of July, next
to the last day of the session, a committee consisting
of one member for each colony was appointed
to serve in the recess of Congress, for the very
practical and urgent purpose of inquiring &#8220;in all
the colonies after virgin lead and leaden ore, and
the best methods of collecting, smelting, and refining
it;&#8221; also, after &#8220;the cheapest and easiest
methods of making salt in these colonies.&#8221; This
was not a committee on which any man could be
useful who had only &#8220;declamation&#8221; to contribute
to its work; and the several colonies were represented
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
upon it by their most sagacious and their
weightiest men,&mdash;as New Hampshire by Langdon,
Massachusetts by John Adams, Rhode Island by
Stephen Hopkins, Pennsylvania by Franklin, Delaware
by Rodney, South Carolina by Gadsden, Virginia
by Patrick Henry.<a name="FNanchor205" id="FNanchor205"></a><a href="#Footnote-205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>On the day on which this committee was appointed,
Patrick Henry wrote to Washington, then
at the headquarters of the army near Boston, a
letter which denoted on the part of the writer a
perception, unusual at that time, of the gravity
and duration of the struggle on which the colonies
were just entering:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right1"><span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>, July 31st, 1775.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Give me leave to recommend the bearer, M<sup>r</sup>.
Frazer, to your notice and regard. He means to enter
the American camp, and there to gain that experience,
of which the general cause may be avail&#8217;d. It is my
earnest wish that many Virginians might see service.
It is not unlikely that in the fluctuation of things our
country may have occasion for great military exertions.
For this reason I have taken the liberty to trouble you
with this and a few others of the same tendency. The
public good which you, sir, have so eminently promoted,
is my only motive. That you may enjoy the protection
of Heaven and live long and happy is the ardent wish
of,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="right9">Sir,</span><br />
<span class="right1">Y<sup>r</sup>. mo. ob<sup>t</sup>. hbl. serv.,</span><br />
<span class="right1 smcap">P. Henry, Jr.<a name="FNanchor206" id="FNanchor206"></a><a href="#Footnote-206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>His Excellency, <span class="smcap">Genl. Washington.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
On the following day Congress adjourned. As
soon as possible after its adjournment, the Virginia
delegates seem to have departed for home, to take
their places in the convention then in session at
Richmond; for the journal of that convention
mentions that on Wednesday, August the 9th,
&#8220;Patrick Henry, Edmund Pendleton, Benjamin
Harrison, and Thomas Jefferson, Esquires, appeared
in convention, and took their seats.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor207" id="FNanchor207"></a><a href="#Footnote-207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> On
the next day an incident occurred in the convention
implying that Patrick Henry, during his absence
in Congress, had been able to serve his colony
by other gifts as well as by those of &#8220;bold and
splendid eloquence:&#8221; it was resolved that &#8220;the
powder purchased by Patrick Henry, Esquire, for
the use of this colony, be immediately sent for.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor208" id="FNanchor208"></a><a href="#Footnote-208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
On the day following that, the convention resolved
unanimously that &#8220;the thanks of this convention
are justly due to his excellency, George Washington,
Esquire, Patrick Henry, and Edmund Pendleton,
Esquires, three of the worthy delegates
who represented this colony in the late Continental
Congress, for their faithful discharge of that
important trust; and this body are only induced
to dispense with their future services of the like
kind, by the appointment of the two former to
other offices in the public service, incompatible
with their attendance on this, and the infirm state
of health of the latter.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor209" id="FNanchor209"></a><a href="#Footnote-209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p><span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Of course, the two appointments here referred
to are of Washington as commander-in-chief of
the forces of the United Colonies, and of Patrick
Henry as commander-in-chief of the forces of Virginia,&mdash;the
latter appointment having been made
by the Virginia convention on the 5th of August.
The commission, which passed the convention on
the 28th of that month, constituted Patrick Henry
&#8220;colonel of the first regiment of regulars, and
commander-in-chief of all the forces to be raised
for the protection and defence of this colony;&#8221;
and while it required &#8220;all officers and soldiers,
and every person whatsoever, in any way concerned,
to be obedient&#8221; to him, &#8220;in all things touching
the due execution of this commission,&#8221; it also required
him to be obedient to &#8220;all orders and instructions
which, from time to time,&#8221; he might
&#8220;receive from the convention or Committee of
Safety.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor210" id="FNanchor210"></a><a href="#Footnote-210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Accordingly, Patrick Henry&#8217;s control
of military proceedings in Virginia was, as it
proved, nothing more than nominal: it was a supreme
command on paper, tempered in actual experience
by the incessant and distrustful interference
of an ever-present body of civilians, who had
all power over him.</p>

<p>A newspaper of Williamsburg for the 23d of
September announces the arrival there, two days
before, of &#8220;Patrick Henry, Esquire, commander-in-chief
of the Virginia forces. He was met and
escorted to town by the whole body of volunteers,<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
who paid him every mark of respect and distinction
in their power.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor211" id="FNanchor211"></a><a href="#Footnote-211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Thereupon he inspected
the grounds about the city; and as a place suitable
for the encampment, he fixed upon a site in the
rear of the College of William and Mary. Soon
troops began to arrive in considerable numbers,
and to prepare themselves for whatever service
might be required of them.<a name="FNanchor212" id="FNanchor212"></a><a href="#Footnote-212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> There was, however,
a sad lack of arms and ammunition. On the 15th
of October, Pendleton, who was at the head of the
Committee of Safety, gave this account of the situation
in a letter to Richard Henry Lee, then in
Congress at Philadelphia:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Had we arms and ammunition, it would give vigor
to our measures.&hellip; Nine companies of regulars are
here, and seem very clever men; others, we hear, are
ready, and only wait to collect arms. Lord Dunmore&#8217;s
forces are only one hundred and sixty as yet, intrenched
at Gosport, and supported by the ships drawn up before
that and Norfolk.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor213" id="FNanchor213"></a><a href="#Footnote-213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>
</div>

<p>On the 30th of November, Lord Dunmore, who
had been compelled by the smallness of his land
force to take refuge upon his armed vessels off the
coast, thus described the situation, in a letter to
General Sir William Howe, then in command at
Boston:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;I must inform you that with our little corps, I think
we have done wonders. We have taken and destroyed
above four score pieces of ordnance, and, by landing in
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
different parts of the country, we keep them in continual
hot water.&hellip; Having heard that a thousand chosen
men belonging to the rebels, great part of whom were
riflemen, were on their march to attack us here, or to
cut off our provisions, I determined to take possession of
the pass at the Great Bridge, which secures us the
greatest part of two counties to supply us with provisions.
I accordingly ordered a stockade fort to be
erected there, which was done in a few days; and I put
an officer and twenty-five men to garrison it, with some
volunteers and negroes, who have defended it against all
the efforts of the rebels for these eight days. We have
killed several of their men; and I make no doubt we
shall now be able to maintain our ground there; but
should we be obliged to abandon it, we have thrown up
an intrenchment on the land side of Norfolk, which I
hope they will never be able to force. Here we are,
with only the small part of a regiment contending
against the extensive colony of Virginia.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor214" id="FNanchor214"></a><a href="#Footnote-214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>
</div>

<p>But who were these &#8220;thousand chosen men belonging
to the rebels,&#8221; who, on their march to
attack Lord Dunmore at Norfolk, had thus been
held in check by his little fort at the Great Bridge?
We are told by Dunmore himself that they were
Virginia troops. But why was not Patrick Henry
in immediate command of them? Why was Patrick
Henry held back from this service,&mdash;the only
active service then to be had in the field? And
why was the direction of this important enterprise
given to his subordinate, Colonel William Woodford,
of the second regiment? There is abundant
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
evidence that Patrick Henry had eagerly desired
to conduct this expedition; that he had even solicited
the Committee of Safety to permit him to do
so; but that they, distrusting his military capacity,
overruled his wishes, and gave this fine opportunity
for military distinction to the officer next
below him in command. Moreover, no sooner had
Colonel Woodford departed upon the service, than
he began to ignore altogether the commander-in-chief,
and to make his communications directly to
the Committee of Safety,&mdash;a course in which he
was virtually sustained by that body, on appeal
being made to them. Furthermore, on the 9th of
December, Colonel Woodford won a brilliant victory
over the enemy at the Great Bridge,<a name="FNanchor215" id="FNanchor215"></a><a href="#Footnote-215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> thus
apparently justifying to the public the wisdom of
the committee in assigning the work to him, and
also throwing still more into the background the
commander-in-chief, who was then chafing in camp
over his enforced retirement from this duty. But
this was not the only cup of humiliation which
was pressed to his lips. Not long afterward, there
arrived at the seat of war a few hundred North
Carolina troops, under command of Colonel Robert
Howe; and the latter, with the full consent of
Woodford, at once took command of their united
forces, and thenceforward addressed his official
letters solely to the convention of Virginia, or to
the Committee of Safety, paying not the slightest
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
attention to the
commander-in-chief.<a name="FNanchor216" id="FNanchor216"></a><a href="#Footnote-216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
Finally, on
the 28th of December, Congress decided to raise
in Virginia six battalions to be taken into continental
pay;<a name="FNanchor217" id="FNanchor217"></a><a href="#Footnote-217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
and, by a subsequent vote, it likewise
resolved to include within these six battalions the
first and the second Virginia regiments already
raised.<a name="FNanchor218" id="FNanchor218"></a><a href="#Footnote-218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
A commission was accordingly sent to
Patrick Henry as colonel of the first Virginia
battalion,<a name="FNanchor219" id="FNanchor219"></a><a href="#Footnote-219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>&mdash;an
official intimation that the expected
commission of a brigadier-general for Virginia
was to be given to some one else.</p>

<p>On receiving this last affront, Patrick Henry
determined to lay down his military appointments,
which he did on the 28th of February, 1776, and
at once prepared to leave the camp. As soon as
this news got abroad among the troops, they all,
according to a contemporary
account,<a name="FNanchor220" id="FNanchor220"></a><a href="#Footnote-220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
&#8220;went into
mourning, and, under arms, waited on him at his
lodgings,&#8221; when his officers presented to him an
affectionate address:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">To Patrick Henry, Junior, Esquire:</span></p>

<p>Deeply impressed with a grateful sense of the obligations
we lie under to you for the polite, humane, and
tender treatment manifested to us throughout the whole
of your conduct, while we have had the honor of being
under your command, permit us to offer to you our sincere
thanks, as the only tribute we have in our power to
pay to your real merits. Notwithstanding your withdrawing
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
yourself from service fills us with the most
poignant sorrow, as it at once deprives us of our father
and general, yet, as gentlemen, we are compelled to applaud
your spirited resentment to the most glaring indignity.
May your merit shine as conspicuous to the
world in general as it hath done to us, and may Heaven
shower its choicest blessings upon you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Williamsburg</span>, February 29, 1776.</p>
</div>

<p>His reply to this warm-hearted message was in
the following words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;I am extremely obliged to you for
your approbation of my conduct. Your address does
me the highest honor. This kind testimony of your
regard to me would have been an ample reward for
services much greater than I have had the power to perform.
I return you, and each of you, gentlemen, my
best acknowledgments for the spirit, alacrity, and zeal
you have constantly shown in your several stations. I
am unhappy to part with you. I leave the service, but
I leave my heart with you. May God bless you, and
give you success and safety, and make you the glorious
instruments of saving our country.<a name="FNanchor221" id="FNanchor221"></a><a href="#Footnote-221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The grief and indignation thus exhibited by the
officers who had served under Patrick Henry soon
showed itself in a somewhat violent manner among
the men. The &#8220;Virginia Gazette&#8221; for that time
states that, &#8220;after the officers had received Colonel
Henry&#8217;s kind answer to their address, they insisted
upon his dining with them at the Raleigh Tavern,
before his departure; and after the dinner, a number
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
of them proposed escorting him out of town,
but were prevented by some uneasiness getting
among the soldiery, who assembled in a tumultuous
manner and demanded their discharge, and declared
their unwillingness to serve under any other
commander. Upon which Colonel Henry found it
necessary to stay a night longer in town, which he
spent in visiting the several barracks; and used
every argument in his power with the soldiery to
lay aside their imprudent resolution, and to continue
in the service, which he had quitted from
motives in which his honor alone was concerned.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor222" id="FNanchor222"></a><a href="#Footnote-222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
Moreover, several days after he had left the camp
altogether and had returned to his home, he was
followed by an address signed by ninety officers
belonging not only to his own regiment, but to
that of Colonel Woodford,&mdash;a document which
has no little value as presenting strongly one side
of contemporary military opinion respecting Patrick
Henry&#8217;s career as a soldier, and the treatment
to which he had been subjected.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Deeply concerned for the good of our country,
we sincerely lament the unhappy necessity of your
resignation, and with all the warmth of affection assure
you that, whatever may have given rise to the indignity
lately offered to you, we join with the general voice of
the people, and think it our duty to make this public
declaration of our high respect for your distinguished
merit. To your vigilance and judgment, as a senator,
this United Continent bears ample testimony, while she
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
prosecutes her steady opposition to those destructive
ministerial measures which your eloquence first pointed
out and taught to resent, and your resolution led forward
to resist. To your extensive popularity the service,
also, is greatly indebted for the expedition with
which the troops were raised; and while they were continued
under your command, the firmness, candor, and
politeness, which formed the complexion of your conduct
towards them, obtained the signal approbation of
the wise and virtuous, and will leave upon our minds
the most grateful impression.</p>

<p>Although retired from the immediate concerns of
war, we solicit the continuance of your kindly attention.
We know your attachment to the best of causes; we
have the fullest confidence in your abilities, and in the
rectitude of your views; and, however willing the envious
may be to undermine an established reputation, we
trust the day will come when justice shall prevail, and
thereby secure you an honorable and happy return to
the glorious employment of conducting our councils and
hazarding your life in the defence of your country.<a name="FNanchor223" id="FNanchor223"></a><a href="#Footnote-223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The public agitation over the alleged wrong
which had thus been done to Patrick Henry during
his brief military career, and which had brought
that career to its abrupt and painful close, seems
to have continued for a considerable time. Throughout
the colony the blame was openly and bluntly
laid upon the Committee of Safety, who, on account
of envy, it was said, had tried &#8220;to bury in
obscurity his martial talents.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor224" id="FNanchor224"></a><a href="#Footnote-224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> On the other
hand, the course pursued by that committee was
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
ably defended by many, on the ground that Patrick
Henry, with all his great gifts for civil life,
really had no fitness for a leading military position.
One writer asserted that even in the convention
which had elected Patrick Henry as commander-in-chief,
it was objected that &#8220;his studies
had been directed to civil and not to military pursuits;
that he was totally unacquainted with the
art of war, and had no knowledge of military discipline;
and that such a person was very unfit to
be at the head of troops who were likely to be
engaged with a well-disciplined army, commanded
by experienced and able generals.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor225" id="FNanchor225"></a><a href="#Footnote-225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> In the very
middle of the period of his nominal military service,
this opinion of his unfitness was still more
strongly urged by the chairman of the Committee
of Safety, who, on the 24th of December, 1775,
said in a letter to Colonel Woodford:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;Believe me, sir, the unlucky step of calling that gentleman
from our councils, where he was useful, into the
field, in an important station, the duties of which he
must, in the nature of things, be an entire stranger to,
has given me many an anxious and uneasy moment. In
consequence of this mistaken step, which can&#8217;t now be
retracted or remedied,&mdash;for he has done nothing worthy
of degradation, and must keep his rank,&mdash;we must be
deprived of the service of some able officers, whose honor
and former ranks will not suffer them to act under him
in this juncture, when we so much need their services.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor226" id="FNanchor226"></a><a href="#Footnote-226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This seems to have been, in substance, the impression
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
concerning Patrick Henry held at that time
by at least two friendly and most competent observers,
who were then looking on from a distance,
and who, of course, were beyond the range of any
personal or partisan prejudice upon the subject.
Writing from Cambridge, on the 7th of March,
1776, before he had received the news of Henry&#8217;s
resignation, Washington said to Joseph Reed, then
at Philadelphia: &#8220;I think my countrymen made
a capital mistake when they took Henry out of the
senate to place him in the field; and pity it is that
he does not see this, and remove every difficulty
by a voluntary resignation.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor227" id="FNanchor227"></a><a href="#Footnote-227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> On the 15th of that
month, Reed, in reply, gave to Washington this
bit of news: &#8220;We have some accounts from Virginia
that Colonel Henry has resigned in disgust
at not being made a general officer; but it rather
gives satisfaction than otherwise, as his abilities
seem better calculated for the senate than the
field.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor228" id="FNanchor228"></a><a href="#Footnote-228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, in all these contemporary judgments
upon the alleged military defects of Patrick
Henry, no reader can now fail to note an embarrassing
lack of definiteness, and a tendency to infer
that, because that great man was so great in civil
life, as a matter of course, he could not be great,
also, in military life,&mdash;a proposition that could
be overthrown by numberless historical examples
to the contrary. It would greatly aid us if we
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
could know precisely what, in actual experience,
were the defects found in Patrick Henry as a military
man, and precisely how these defects were
exhibited by him in the camp at Williamsburg.
In the writings of that period, no satisfaction upon
this point seems thus far to have been obtained.
There is, however, a piece of later testimony,
derived by authentic tradition from a prominent
member of the Virginia Committee of Safety,
which really helps one to understand what may
have been the exact difficulty with the military
character of Patrick Henry, and just why, also,
it could not be more plainly stated at the time.
Clement Carrington, a son of Paul Carrington,
told Hugh Blair Grigsby that the real ground of
the action of the Committee of Safety &#8220;was the
want of discipline in the regiment under the command
of Colonel Henry. None doubted his courage,
or his alacrity to hasten to the field; but it
was plain that he did not seem to be conscious of
the importance of strict discipline in the army, but
regarded his soldiers as so many gentlemen who
had met to defend their country, and exacted from
them little more than the courtesy that was proper
among equals. To have marched to the sea-board
at that time with a regiment of such men, would
have been to insure their destruction; and it was
a thorough conviction of this truth that prompted
the decision of the committee.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor229" id="FNanchor229"></a><a href="#Footnote-229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>Yet, even with this explanation, the truth remains
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
that Patrick Henry, as commander-in-chief
of the Virginia forces, never was permitted to take
command, or to see any real service in the field,
or to look upon the face of an armed enemy, or to
show, in the only way in which it could be shown,
whether or not he had the gifts of a military leader
in action. As an accomplished and noble-minded
Virginian of our own time has said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;It may be doubted whether he possessed those qualities
which make a wary partisan, and which are so often
possessed in an eminent degree by uneducated men.
Regular fighting there was none in the colony, until near
the close of the war.&hellip; The most skilful partisan in
the Virginia of that day, covered as it was with forests,
cut up by streams, and beset by predatory bands, would
have been the Indian warrior; and as a soldier approached
that model, would he have possessed the proper
tactics for the time. That Henry would not have made
a better Indian fighter than Jay, or Livingston, or the
Adamses, that he might not have made as dashing a
partisan as Tarleton or Simcoe, his friends might readily
afford to concede; but that he evinced, what neither
Jay, nor Livingston, nor the Adamses did evince, a determined
resolution to stake his reputation and his life
on the issue of arms, and that he resigned his commission
when the post of imminent danger was refused
him, exhibit a lucid proof that, whatever may have been
his ultimate fortune, he was not deficient in two grand
elements of military success,&mdash;personal enterprise, and
unquestioned courage.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor230" id="FNanchor230"></a><a href="#Footnote-230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII <br />
<span class="hsub">INDEPENDENCE</span></h2>


<p>Upon this mortifying close of a military career
which had opened with so much expectation and
even <i>&eacute;clat</i>, Patrick Henry returned, early in
March, 1776, to his home in the county of Hanover,&mdash;a
home on which then rested the shadow
of a great sorrow. In the midst of the public engagements
and excitements which absorbed him
during the previous year, his wife, Sarah, the wife
of his youth, the mother of his six children, had
passed away. His own subsequent release from
public labor, however bitter in its occasion, must
have brought to him a great solace in the few
weeks of repose which he then had under his own
roof, with the privilege of ministering to the happiness
of his motherless children, and of enjoying
once more their loving companionship and sympathy.</p>

<p>But in such a crisis of his country&#8217;s fate, such
a man as Patrick Henry could not be permitted
long to remain in seclusion; and the promptness
and the heartiness with which he was now summoned
back into the service of the public as a
civilian, after the recent humiliations of his military
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
career, were accented, perhaps, on the part
of his neighbors, by something of the fervor of intended
compensation, if not of intended revenge.
For, in the mean time, the American colonies had
been swiftly advancing, along a path strewn with
corpses and wet with blood, towards the doctrine
that a total separation from the mother-country,&mdash;a
thing hitherto contemplated by them only as a
disaster and a crime,&mdash;might after all be neither,
but on the contrary, the only resource left to them
in their desperate struggle for political existence.
This supreme question, it was plain, was to confront
the very next Virginia convention, which
was under appointment to meet early in the coming
May. Almost at once, therefore, after his
return home, Patrick Henry was elected by his
native county to represent it in that convention.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, the 6th of May, the convention
gathered at Williamsburg for its first
meeting. On its roll of members we see many of
those names which have become familiar to us in
the progress of this history,&mdash;the names of those
sturdy and well-trained leaders who guided Virginia
during all that stormy period,&mdash;Pendleton, Cary,
Mason, Nicholas, Bland, the Lees, Mann Page,
Dudley Digges, Wythe, Edmund Randolph, and
a few others. For the first time also, on such a
roll, we meet the name of James Madison, an
accomplished young political philosopher, then but
four years from the inspiring instruction of President
Witherspoon at Princeton. But while a few
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
very able men had places in that convention, it
was, at the time, by some observers thought to
contain an unusually large number of incompetent
persons. Three days after the opening of the session
Landon Carter wrote to Washington:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;I could have wished that ambition had not so visibly
seized so much ignorance all over the colony, as it seems
to have done; for this present convention abounds with
too many of the inexperienced creatures to navigate our
bark on this dangerous coast; so that I fear the few skilful
pilots who have hitherto done tolerably well to keep her
clear from destruction, will not be able to conduct her
with common safety any longer.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor231" id="FNanchor231"></a><a href="#Footnote-231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The earliest organization of the House was, on
the part of the friends of Patrick Henry, made
the occasion for a momentary flash of resentment
against Edmund Pendleton, as the man who was
believed by them to have been the guiding mind
of the Committee of Safety in its long series of
restraints upon the military activity of their chief.
At the opening of the convention Pendleton was
nominated for its president,&mdash;a most suitable
nomination, and one which under ordinary circumstances
would have been carried by acclamation.
Thomas Johnson, however, a stanch follower of
Patrick Henry, at once presented an opposing candidate;
and although Pendleton was elected, he
was not elected without a contest, or without this
significant hint that the fires of indignation against
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
him were still burning in the hearts of a strong
party in that house and throughout the colony.</p>

<p>The convention lasted just two months lacking
a day; and in all the detail and drudgery of its
business, as the journal indicates, Patrick Henry
bore a very large part. In the course of the session,
he seems to have served on perhaps a majority
of all its committees. On the 6th of May, he
was made a member of the committee of privileges
and elections; on the 7th, of a committee &#8220;to
bring in an ordinance to encourage the making of
salt, saltpetre, and gunpowder;&#8221; on the 8th, of
the committee on &#8220;propositions and grievances;&#8221;
on the 21st, of a committee &#8220;to inquire for a
proper hospital for the reception and accommodation
of the sick and wounded soldiers;&#8221; on the
22d, of a committee to inquire into the truth of
a complaint made by the Indians respecting encroachments
on their lands; on the 23d, of a committee
to bring in an ordinance for augmenting
the ninth regiment, for enlisting four troops of
horse, and for raising men for the defence of the
frontier counties; on the 4th of June, of a committee
to inquire into the causes for the depreciation
of paper money in the colony, and into the
rates at which goods are sold at the public store;
on the 14th of June, of a committee to prepare an
address to be sent by Virginia to the Shawanese
Indians; on the 15th of June, of a committee to
bring in amendments to the ordinance for prescribing
a mode of punishment for the enemies of
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
America in this colony; and on the 22d of June,
of a committee to prepare an ordinance &#8220;for enabling
the present magistrates to continue the administration
of justice, and for settling the general
mode of proceedings in criminal and other cases.&#8221;
The journal also mentions his frequent activity in
the House in the presentation of reports from some
of these committees: for example, from the committee
on propositions and grievances, on the 16th
of May, on the 22d of May, and on the 15th of
June. On the latter occasion, he made to the
House three detailed reports on as many different
topics.<a name="FNanchor232" id="FNanchor232"></a><a href="#Footnote-232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>Of course, the question overshadowing all others
in that convention was the question of independence.
General Charles Lee, whose military duties
just then detained him at Williamsburg, and
who was intently watching the currents of political
thought in all the colonies, assured Washington,
in a letter written on the 10th of May, that &#8220;a
noble spirit&#8221; possessed the convention; and that
the members were &#8220;almost unanimous for independence,&#8221;
the only disagreement being &#8220;in their
sentiments about the mode.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor233" id="FNanchor233"></a><a href="#Footnote-233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> That Patrick
Henry was in favor of independence hardly needs
to be mentioned; yet it does need to be mentioned
that he was among those who disagreed with some
of his associates &#8220;about the mode.&#8221; While he
was as eager and as resolute for independence as
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
any man, he doubted whether the time had then
fully come for declaring independence. He thought
that the declaration should be so timed as to secure,
beyond all doubt, two great conditions of success,&mdash;first,
the firm union of the colonies themselves,
and secondly, the friendship of foreign powers,
particularly of France and Spain. For these reasons,
he would have had independence delayed
until a confederation of the colonies could be established
by written articles, which, he probably
supposed, would take but a few weeks; and also
until American agents could have time to negotiate
with the French and Spanish courts.</p>

<p>On the first day of the session, General Charles
Lee, who was hot for an immediate declaration of
independence, seems to have had a conversation
upon the subject with Patrick Henry, during which
the latter stated his reasons for some postponement
of the measure. This led General Lee, on the
following day, to write to Henry a letter which is
really remarkable, some passages from which will
help us the better to understand the public situation,
as well as Patrick Henry&#8217;s attitude towards
it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right1"><span class="smcap">Williamsburg</span>, May 7, 1776.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;If I had not the highest opinion of your
character and liberal way of thinking, I should not venture
to address myself to you. And if I were not equally
persuaded of the great weight and influence which the
transcendent abilities you possess must naturally confer,
I should not give myself the trouble of writing, nor you
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
the trouble of reading this long letter. Since our conversation
yesterday, my thoughts have been solely employed
on the great question, whether independence
ought or ought not to be immediately declared. Having
weighed the argument on both sides, I am clearly of the
opinion that we must, as we value the liberties of America,
or even her existence, without a moment&#8217;s delay
declare for independence.&hellip; The objection you made
yesterday, if I understood you rightly, to an immediate
declaration, was by many degrees the most specious,
indeed, it is the only tolerable, one that I have yet heard.
You say, and with great justice, that we ought previously
to have felt the pulse of France and Spain. I more than
believe, I am almost confident, that it has been done.&hellip;
But admitting that we are utter strangers to their sentiments
on the subject, and that we run some risk of this
declaration being coldly received by these powers, such
is our situation that the risk must be ventured.</p>

<p>On one side there are the most probable chances of
our success, founded on the certain advantages which
must manifest themselves to French understandings by
a treaty of alliance with America.&hellip; The superior
commerce and marine force of England were evidently
established on the monopoly of her American trade.
The inferiority of France, in these two capital points,
consequently had its source in the same origin. Any
deduction from this monopoly must bring down her
rival in proportion to this deduction. The French are
and always have been sensible of these great truths.&hellip;
But allowing that there can be no certainty, but mere
chances, in our favor, I do insist upon it that these
chances render it our duty to adopt the measure, as, by
procrastination, our ruin is inevitable. Should it now
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
be determined to wait the result of a previous formal
negotiation with France, a whole year must pass over
our heads before we can be acquainted with the result.
In the mean time, we are to struggle through a campaign,
without arms, ammunition, or any one necessary
of war. Disgrace and defeat will infallibly ensue; the
soldiers and officers will become so disappointed that
they will abandon their colors, and probably never be
persuaded to make another effort.</p>

<p>But there is another consideration still more cogent.
I can assure you that the spirit of the people cries out
for this declaration; the military, in particular, men
and officers, are outrageous on the subject; and a man
of your excellent discernment need not be told how
dangerous it would be, in our present circumstances, to
dally with the spirit, or disappoint the expectations, of
the bulk of the people. May not despair, anarchy, and
final submission be the bitter fruits? I am firmly persuaded
that they will; and, in this persuasion, I most
devoutly pray that you may not merely recommend, but
positively lay injunctions on, your servants in Congress
to embrace a measure so necessary to our salvation.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="right3">Yours, most sincerely,</span><br />

<span class="right1"><span class="smcap">Charles Lee.</span><a name="FNanchor234" id="FNanchor234"></a><a href="#Footnote-234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>Just eight days after that letter was written,
the Virginia convention took what may, at first
glance, seem to be the precise action therein described
as necessary; and moreover, they did so
under the influence, in part, of Patrick Henry&#8217;s
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
powerful advocacy of it. On the 15th of May,
after considerable debate, one hundred and twelve
members being present, the convention unanimously
resolved,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;That the delegates appointed to represent this colony
in General Congress be instructed to propose to that respectable
body to declare the United Colonies free and
independent States, absolved from all allegiance to, or
dependence upon, the crown or Parliament of Great Britain;
and that they give the assent of this colony to such
declaration, and to whatever measures may be thought
proper and necessary by the Congress for forming foreign
alliances and a confederation of the colonies, at such
time, and in the manner, as to them shall seem best:
provided, that the power of forming government for,
and the regulations of the internal concerns of, each
colony, be left to the respective colonial legislatures.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor235" id="FNanchor235"></a><a href="#Footnote-235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p></div>

<p>On the testimony of Edmund Randolph, who
was a member of the convention, it is now known
that this momentous resolution &#8220;was drawn by
Pendleton, was offered in convention by Nelson,
and was advocated on the floor by Henry.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor236" id="FNanchor236"></a><a href="#Footnote-236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Any
one who will carefully study it, however, will discover
that this resolution was the result of a compromise;
and especially, that it is so framed as to
meet Patrick Henry&#8217;s views, at least to the extent
of avoiding the demand for an immediate declaration,<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
and of leaving it to Congress to determine
the time and manner of making it. Accordingly,
in letters of his, written five days afterward to his
most intimate friends in Congress, we see that his
mind was still full of anxiety about the two great
prerequisites,&mdash;a certified union among the colonies,
and a friendly arrangement with France.
&#8220;Ere this reaches you,&#8221; he wrote to Richard
Henry Lee, &#8220;our resolution for separating from
Britain will be handed you by Colonel Nelson.
Your sentiments as to the necessary progress of
this great affair correspond with mine. For may
not France, ignorant of the great advantages to
her commerce we intend to offer, and of the
permanency of that separation which is to take
place, be allured by the partition you mention?
To anticipate, therefore, the efforts of the enemy
by sending instantly American ambassadors to
France, seems to me absolutely necessary. Delay
may bring on us total ruin. But is not a confederacy
of our States previously necessary?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor237" id="FNanchor237"></a><a href="#Footnote-237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>On the same day, he wrote, also, a letter to
John Adams, in which he developed still more
vigorously his views as to the true order in which
the three great measures,&mdash;confederation, foreign
alliances, and independence,&mdash;should be dealt
with:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;Before this reaches you, the resolution for finally
separating from Britain will be handed to Congress by
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Colonel Nelson. I put up with it in the present form
for the sake of unanimity. &#8217;T is not quite so pointed as
I could wish. Excuse me for telling you of what I think
of immense importance; &#8217;t is to anticipate the enemy at
the French court. The half of our continent offered to
France, may induce her to aid our destruction, which
she certainly has the power to accomplish. I know the
free trade with all the States would be more beneficial
to her than any territorial possessions she might acquire.
But pressed, allured, as she will be,&mdash;but, above all,
ignorant of the great thing we mean to offer,&mdash;may we
not lose her? The consequence is dreadful. Excuse
me again. The confederacy:&mdash;that must precede an
open declaration of independency and foreign alliances.
Would it not be sufficient to confine it, for the present,
to the objects of offensive and defensive nature, and a
guaranty of the respective colonial rights? If a minute
arrangement of things is attempted, such as equal representation,
etc., etc., you may split and divide; certainly
will delay the French alliance, which with me is everything.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor238" id="FNanchor238"></a><a href="#Footnote-238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the mean time, however, many of the people
of Virginia had received with enthusiastic approval
the news of the great step taken by their convention
on the 15th of May. Thus &#8220;on the day following,&#8221;
says the &#8220;Virginia Gazette,&#8221; published
at Williamsburg, &#8220;the troops in this city, with
the train of artillery, were drawn up and went
through their firings and various other military
man&#339;uvres, with the greatest exactness; a continental
union flag was displayed upon the capitol;<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
and in the evening many of the inhabitants illuminated
their houses.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor239" id="FNanchor239"></a><a href="#Footnote-239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Moreover, the great step
taken by the Virginia convention, on the day just
mentioned, committed that body to the duty of
taking at once certain other steps of supreme importance.
They were about to cast off the government
of Great Britain: it was necessary for them,
therefore, to provide some government to be put
in the place of it. Accordingly, in the very same
hour in which they instructed their delegates in
Congress to propose a declaration of independence,
they likewise resolved, &#8220;That a committee be appointed
to prepare a declaration of rights, and
such a plan of government as will be most likely
to maintain peace and order in this colony, and
secure substantial and equal liberty to the people.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor240" id="FNanchor240"></a><a href="#Footnote-240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>Of this committee, Patrick Henry was a member;
and with him were associated Archibald Cary,
Henry Lee, Nicholas, Edmund Randolph, Bland,
Dudley Digges, Paul Carrington, Mann Page,
Madison, George Mason, and others. The two
tasks before the committee&mdash;that of drafting a
statement of rights, and that of drafting a constitution
for the new State of Virginia&mdash;must have
pressed heavily upon its leading members. In the
work of creating a new state government, Virginia
was somewhat in advance of the other colonies;
and for this reason, as well as on account of
its general pre&euml;minence among the colonies, the
course which it should take in this crisis was
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
watched with extraordinary attention. John
Adams said, at the time, &#8220;We all look up to Virginia
for examples.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor241" id="FNanchor241"></a><a href="#Footnote-241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> Besides, in Virginia itself,
as well as in the other colonies, there was an unsettled
question as to the nature of the state governments
which were then to be instituted. Should
they be strongly aristocratic and conservative, with
a possible place left for the monarchical feature;
or should the popular elements in each colony be
more largely recognized, and a decidedly democratic
character given to these new constitutions?
On this question, two strong parties existed in
Virginia. In the first place, there were the old
aristocratic families, and those who sympathized
with them. These people, numerous, rich, cultivated,
influential, in objecting to the unfair encroachments
of British authority, had by no means
intended to object to the nature of the British
constitution, and would have been pleased to see
that constitution, in all its essential features, retained
in Virginia. This party was led by such
men as Robert Carter Nicholas, Carter Braxton,
and Edmund Pendleton. In the second place,
there were the democrats, the reformers, the radicals,&mdash;who
were inclined to take the opportunity
furnished by Virginia&#8217;s rejection of British authority
as the occasion for rejecting, within the new
State of Virginia, all the aristocratic and monarchical
features of the British Constitution itself.
This party was led by such men as Patrick Henry,<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
Richard Henry Lee, Thomas Jefferson, and George
Mason. Which party was to succeed in stamping
its impress the more strongly on the new plan for
government in Virginia?</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is important to observe that, on
this very question then at issue in Virginia, two
pamphlets, taking opposite sides, were, just at that
moment, attracting the notice of Virginians,&mdash;both
pamphlets being noble in tone, of considerable
learning, very suggestive, and very well expressed.
The first, entitled &#8220;Thoughts on Government,&#8221;
though issued anonymously, was soon
known to be by John Adams. It advocated the
formation of state constitutions on the democratic
model; a lower house elected for a single year by
the people; this house to elect an upper house of
twenty or thirty members, who were to have a
negative on the lower house, and to serve, likewise,
for a single year; these two houses to elect a governor,
who was to have a negative on them both,
and whose term of office should also end with the
year; while the judges, and all other officers, civil
or military, were either to be appointed by the
governor with the advice of the upper house, or to
be chosen directly by the two houses themselves.<a name="FNanchor242" id="FNanchor242"></a><a href="#Footnote-242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
The second pamphlet, which was in part a reply
to the first, was entitled &#8220;Address to the Convention
of the Colony and Ancient Dominion of Virginia,
on the subject of Government in general,
and recommending a particular form to their consideration.&#8221;<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
It purported to be by &#8220;A native of
the Colony.&#8221; Although the pamphlet was sent
into Virginia under strong recommendations from
Carter Braxton, one of the Virginian delegates in
Congress, the authorship was then unknown to the
public. It advocated the formation of state constitutions
on a model far less democratic: first, a
lower house, the members of which were to be
elected for three years by the people; secondly,
an upper house of twenty-four members, to be
elected for life by the lower house; thirdly, a
governor, to be elected for life by the lower house;
fourthly, all judges, all military officers, and all
inferior civil ones, to be appointed by the governor.<a name="FNanchor243" id="FNanchor243"></a><a href="#Footnote-243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>Such was the question over which the members
of the committee, appointed on the 15th of May,
must soon have come into sharp conflict. At its
earliest meetings, apparently, Henry found the
aristocratic tendencies of some of his associates so
strong as to give him considerable uneasiness; and
by his letter to John Adams, written on the 20th
of the month, we may see that he was then complaining
of the lack of any associate of adequate
ability on his own side of the question. When
we remember, however, that both James Madison
and George Mason were members of that committee,
we can but read Patrick Henry&#8217;s words with
some astonishment.<a name="FNanchor244" id="FNanchor244"></a><a href="#Footnote-244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> The explanation is probably
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
to be found in the fact that Madison was not placed
on the committee until the 16th, and, being very
young and very unobtrusive, did not at first make
his true weight felt; while Mason was not placed
on the committee until the working day just before
Henry&#8217;s letter was written, and very likely had
not then met with it, and may not, at the moment,
have been remembered by Henry as a member of
it. At any rate, this is the way in which our
eager Virginia democrat, in that moment of anxious
conflict over the form of the future government
of his State, poured out his anxieties to his
two most congenial political friends in Congress.
To Richard Henry Lee he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;The grand work of forming a constitution for Virginia
is now before the convention, where your love of
equal liberty and your skill in public counsels might so
eminently serve the cause of your country. Perhaps
I&#8217;m mistaken, but I fear too great a bias to aristocracy
prevails among the opulent. I own myself a democratic
on the plan of our admired friend, J. Adams, whose
pamphlet I read with great pleasure. A performance
from Philadelphia is just come here, ushered in, I&#8217;m
told, by a colleague of yours, B&mdash;&mdash;, and greatly recommended
by him. I don&#8217;t like it. Is the author a
Whig? One or two expressions in the book make me
ask. I wish to divide you, and have you here to animate,
by your manly eloquence, the sometimes drooping
spirits of our country, and in Congress to be the ornament
of your native country, and the vigilant, determined
foe of tyranny. To give you colleagues of kindred
sentiments, is my wish. I doubt you have them
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
not at present. A confidential account of the matter to
Colonel Tom,<a name="FNanchor245" id="FNanchor245"></a><a href="#Footnote-245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> desiring him to use it according to his
discretion, might greatly serve the public and vindicate
Virginia from suspicions. Vigor, animation, and all
the powers of mind and body must now be summoned
and collected together into one grand effort. Moderation,
falsely so called, hath nearly brought on us final
ruin. And to see those, who have so fatally advised us,
still guiding, or at least sharing, our public counsels,
alarms me.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor246" id="FNanchor246"></a><a href="#Footnote-246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>
</div>

<p>On the same day, he wrote as follows to John
Adams:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right1"><span class="smcap">Williamsburg</span>, May 20, 1776.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your favor, with the pamphlet,
came safe to hand. I am exceedingly obliged to you
for it; and I am not without hopes it may produce good
here, where there is among most of our opulent families
a strong bias to aristocracy. I tell my friends you are
the author. Upon that supposition, I have two reasons
for liking the book. The sentiments are precisely the
same I have long since taken up, and they come recommended
by you. Go on, my dear friend, to assail the
strongholds of tyranny; and in whatever form oppression
may be found, may those talents and that firmness,
which have achieved so much for America, be pointed
against it.&hellip;</p>

<p>Our convention is now employed in the great work of
forming a constitution. My most esteemed republican
form has many and powerful enemies. A silly thing,
published in Philadelphia, by a native of Virginia, has
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
just made its appearance here, strongly recommended,
&#8216;t is said, by one of our delegates now with you,&mdash;Braxton.
His reasonings upon and distinction between private
and public virtue, are weak, shallow, evasive, and
the whole performance an affront and disgrace to this
country; and, by one expression, I suspect his whiggism.</p>

<p>Our session will be very long, during which I cannot
count upon one coadjutor of talents equal to the task.
Would to God you and your Sam Adams were here!
It shall be my incessant study so to form our portrait of
government that a kindred with New England may be
discerned in it; and if all your excellences cannot be
preserved, yet I hope to retain so much of the likeness,
that posterity shall pronounce us descended from the
same stock. I shall think perfection is obtained, if we
have your approbation.</p>

<p>I am forced to conclude; but first, let me beg to be
presented to my ever-esteemed S. Adams. Adieu, my
dear sir; may God preserve you, and give you every
good thing.</p>

<p class="right1 smcap">P. Henry, Jr.</p>

<p>P. S. Will you and S. A. now and then write?<a name="FNanchor247" id="FNanchor247"></a><a href="#Footnote-247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>
</div>

<p>To this hearty and even brotherly letter John
Adams wrote from Philadelphia, on the 3d of
June, a fitting reply, in the course of which he
said, with respect to Henry&#8217;s labors in making a
constitution for Virginia: &#8220;The subject is of infinite
moment, and perhaps more than adequate to
the abilities of any man in America. I know of
none so competent to the task as the author of the
first Virginia resolutions against the Stamp Act,
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
who will have the glory with posterity of beginning
and concluding this great revolution. Happy
Virginia, whose constitution is to be framed by so
masterly a builder!&#8221; Then, with respect to the
aristocratic features in the Constitution, as proposed
by &#8220;A Native of the Colony,&#8221; John Adams
exclaims:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The dons, the bashaws, the grandees, the patricians,
the sachems, the nabobs, call them by what name you
please, sigh, and groan, and fret, and sometimes stamp,
and foam, and curse, but all in vain. The decree is
gone forth, and it cannot be recalled, that a more equal
liberty than has prevailed in other parts of the earth,
must be established in America. That exuberance of
pride which has produced an insolent domination in a
few, a very few, opulent, monopolizing families, will be
brought down nearer to the confines of reason and moderation
than they have been used to.&hellip; I shall ever
be happy in receiving your advice by letter, until I can
be more completely so in seeing you here in person,
which I hope will be soon.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor248" id="FNanchor248"></a><a href="#Footnote-248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>
</div>

<p>On the 12th of June, the convention adopted
without a dissenting voice its celebrated &#8220;declaration
of rights,&#8221; a compact, luminous, and powerful
statement, in sixteen articles, of those great
fundamental rights that were henceforth to be
&#8220;the basis and foundation of government&#8221; in
Virginia, and were to stamp their character upon
that constitution on which the committee were even
then engaged. Perhaps no political document of
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
that time is more worthy of study in connection
with the genesis, not only of our state constitutions,
but of that of the nation likewise. That
the first fourteen articles of the declaration were
written by George Mason has never been disputed:
that he also wrote the fifteenth and the sixteenth
articles is now claimed by his latest and ablest
biographer,<a name="FNanchor249" id="FNanchor249"></a><a href="#Footnote-249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> but in opposition to the testimony of
Edmund Randolph, who was a member both of
the convention itself and of the particular committee
in charge of the declaration, and who has left
on record the statement that those articles were
the work of Patrick Henry.<a name="FNanchor250" id="FNanchor250"></a><a href="#Footnote-250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> The fifteenth article
was in these words: &#8220;That no free government,
or the blessings of liberty, can be preserved to any
people but by a firm adherence to justice, moderation,
temperance, frugality, and virtue, and by
frequent recurrence to fundamental principles.&#8221;
The sixteenth article is an assertion of the doctrine
of religious liberty,&mdash;the first time that it was
ever asserted by authority in Virginia. The original
draft, in which the writer followed very closely
the language used on that subject by the Independents
in the Assembly of Westminster, stood as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;That religion, or the duty we owe our Creator, and
the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by
reason and conviction, and not by force or violence; and,<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
therefore, that all men should enjoy the fullest toleration
in the exercise of religion, according to the dictates of
conscience, unpunished and unrestrained by the magistrate,
unless, under color of religion, any man disturb
the peace, the happiness, or the safety of society; and
that it is the mutual duty of all to practise Christian forbearance,
love, and charity towards each other.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor251" id="FNanchor251"></a><a href="#Footnote-251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The historic significance of this stately assertion
of religious liberty in Virginia can be felt only by
those who remember that, at that time, the Church
of England was the established church of Virginia,
and that the laws of Virginia then restrained the
exercise there of every form of religious dissent,
unless compliance had been made with the conditions
of the toleration act of the first year of William
and Mary. At the very moment, probably,
when the committee were engaged in considering
the tremendous innovation contained in this article,
&#8220;sundry persons of the Baptist church in the
county of Prince William&#8221; were putting their
names to a petition earnestly imploring the convention,
&#8220;That they be allowed to worship God
in their own way, without interruption; that they
be permitted to maintain their own ministers and
none others; that they may be married, buried,
and the like, without paying the clergy of other
denominations;&#8221; and that, by the concession to
them of such religious freedom, they be enabled
to &#8220;unite with their brethren, and to the utmost
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
of their ability promote the common cause&#8221; of
political freedom.<a name="FNanchor252" id="FNanchor252"></a><a href="#Footnote-252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> Of course the adoption of the
sixteenth article virtually carried with it every
privilege which these people asked for. The author
of that article, whether it was George Mason
or Patrick Henry, was a devout communicant of
the established church of Virginia; and thus, the
first great legislative act for the reform of the
civil constitution of that church, and for its deliverance
from the traditional duty and curse of persecution,
was an act which came from within the
church itself.</p>

<p>On Monday, the 24th of June, the committee,
through Archibald Cary, submitted to the convention
their plan of a constitution for the new State
of Virginia; and on Saturday, the 29th of June,
this plan passed its third reading, and was unanimously
adopted. A glance at the document will
show that in the sharp struggle between the aristocratic
and the democratic forces in the convention,
the latter had signally triumphed. It provided
for a lower House of Assembly, whose members
were to be elected annually by the people, in the
proportion of two members from each county; for
an upper House of Assembly to consist of twenty-four
members, who were to be elected annually by
the people, in the proportion of one member from
each of the senatorial districts into which the several
counties should be grouped; for a governor,
to be elected annually by joint ballot of both
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
houses, and not to &#8220;continue in that office longer
than three years successively,&#8221; nor then to be eligible
again for the office until after the lapse of
four years from the close of his previous term; for
a privy council of eight members, for delegates in
Congress, and for judges in the several courts, all
to be elected by joint ballot of the two Houses; for
justices of the peace to be appointed by the governor
and the privy council; and, finally, for an
immediate election, by the convention itself, of a
governor, and a privy council, and such other officers
as might be necessary for the introduction of
the new government.<a name="FNanchor253" id="FNanchor253"></a><a href="#Footnote-253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>In accordance with the last provision of this
Constitution, the convention at once proceeded to
cast their ballots for governor, with the following
result:&mdash;</p>



<div class="blockquot">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">For Patrick Henry</td><td align="right">60</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">For Thomas Nelson&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="right">45</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">For John Page</td><td align="right">1</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>By resolution, Patrick Henry was then formally
declared to be the governor of the commonwealth
of Virginia, to continue in office until the close of
that session of the Assembly which should be held
after the end of the following March.</p>

<p>On the same day on which this action was taken,
he wrote, in reply to the official notice of his election,
the following letter of acceptance,&mdash;a graceful,
manly, and touching composition:&mdash;<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">TO THE HONORABLE THE PRESIDENT AND HOUSE OF
CONVENTION.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;The vote of this day, appointing me
governor of this commonwealth, has been notified to
me, in the most polite and obliging manner, by George
Mason, Henry Lee, Dudley Digges, John Blair, and
Bartholomew Dandridge, Esquires.</p>

<p>A sense of the high and unmerited honor conferred
upon me by the convention fills my heart with gratitude,
which I trust my whole life will manifest. I take this
earliest opportunity to express my thanks, which I wish
to convey to you, gentlemen, in the strongest terms of
acknowledgment.</p>

<p>When I reflect that the tyranny of the British king
and parliament hath kindled a formidable war, now raging
throughout the wide-extended continent, and in the
operations of which this commonwealth must bear so
great a part, and that from the events of this war the
lasting happiness or misery of a great proportion of the
human species will finally result; that, in order to preserve
this commonwealth from anarchy, and its attendant
ruin, and to give vigor to our councils and effect to
all our measures, government hath been necessarily assumed
and new modelled; that it is exposed to numberless
hazards and perils in its infantine state; that it can
never attain to maturity or ripen into firmness, unless
it is guarded by affectionate assiduity, and managed by
great abilities,&mdash;I lament my want of talents; I feel
my mind filled with anxiety and uneasiness to find myself
so unequal to the duties of that important station to
which I am called by favor of my fellow citizens at this
truly critical conjuncture. The errors of my conduct
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
shall be atoned for, so far as I am able, by unwearied
endeavors to secure the freedom and happiness of our
common country.</p>

<p>I shall enter upon the duties of my office whenever
you, gentlemen, shall be pleased to direct, relying upon
the known wisdom and virtue of your honorable house
to supply my defects, and to give permanency and success
to that system of government which you have
formed, and which is so wisely calculated to secure equal
liberty, and advance human happiness.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, gentlemen, your most obedient
and very humble servant,</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII <br />
<span class="hsub">FIRST GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF VIRGINIA</span></h2>


<p>On Friday, the 5th of July, 1776, Patrick
Henry took the oath of office,<a name="FNanchor255" id="FNanchor255"></a><a href="#Footnote-255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> and entered upon
his duties as governor of the commonwealth of
Virginia. The salary attached to the position was
fixed at one thousand pounds sterling for the year;
and the governor was invited to take up his residence
in the palace at Williamsburg. No one
had resided in the palace since Lord Dunmore
had fled from it; and the people of Virginia could
hardly fail to note the poetic retribution whereby
the very man whom, fourteen months before, Lord
Dunmore had contemptuously denounced as &#8220;a
certain Patrick Henry of Hanover County,&#8221; should
now become Lord Dunmore&#8217;s immediate successor
in that mansion of state, and should be able, if he
chose, to write proclamations against Lord Dunmore
upon the same desk on which Lord Dunmore
had so recently written the proclamation against
himself.</p>

<p>Among the first to bring their congratulations
to the new governor, were his devoted friends, the
first and second regiments of Virginia, who told
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
him that they viewed &#8220;with the sincerest sentiments
of respect and joy&#8221; his accession to the
highest office in the State, and who gave to him
likewise this affectionate assurance: &#8220;our hearts
are willing, and arms ready, to maintain your
authority as chief magistrate.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor256" id="FNanchor256"></a><a href="#Footnote-256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> On the 29th of
July, the erratic General Charles Lee, who was
then in Charleston, sent on his congratulations in
a letter amusing for its tart cordiality and its peppery
playfulness:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;I most sincerely congratulate you on the noble conduct
of your countrymen; and I congratulate your country
on having citizens deserving of the high honor to
which you are exalted. For the being elected to the
first magistracy of a free people is certainly the pinnacle
of human glory; and I am persuaded that they could
not have made a happier choice. Will you excuse me,&mdash;but
I am myself so extremely democratical, that I think
it a fault in your constitution that the governor should be
eligible for three years successively. It appears to me
that a government of three years may furnish an opportunity
of acquiring a very dangerous influence. But this
is not the worst.&hellip; A man who is fond of office, and
has his eye upon re&euml;lection, will be courting favor and
popularity at the expense of his duty.&hellip; There is a
barbarism crept in among us that extremely shocks me:
I mean those tinsel epithets with which (I come in for
my share) we are so beplastered,&mdash;&#8216;his excellency,&#8217;
and &#8216;his honor,&#8217; &#8216;the honorable president of the honorable
congress,&#8217; or &#8216;the honorable convention.&#8217; This fulsome,
nauseating cant may be well enough adapted to
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
barbarous monarchies, or to gratify the adulterated pride
of the &#8216;magnifici&#8217; in pompous aristocracies; but in a
great, free, manly, equal commonwealth, it is quite
abominable. For my own part, I would as lief they
would put ratsbane in my mouth as the &#8216;excellency&#8217;
with which I am daily crammed. How much more true
dignity was there in the simplicity of address amongst
the Romans,&mdash;&#8216;Marcus Tullius Cicero,&#8217; &#8216;Decimo Bruto
Imperatori,&#8217; or &#8216;Caio Marcello Consuli,&#8217;&mdash;than to &#8216;his
excellency Major-General Noodle,&#8217; or to &#8216;the honorable
John Doodle.&#8217; &hellip; If, therefore, I should sometimes
address a letter to you without the &#8216;excellency&#8217; tacked,
you must not esteem it a mark of personal or official disrespect,
but the reverse.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor257" id="FNanchor257"></a><a href="#Footnote-257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Of all the words of congratulation which poured
in upon the new governor, probably none came so
straight from the heart, and none could have been
quite so sweet to him, as those which, on the 12th
of August, were uttered by some of the persecuted
dissenters in Virginia, who, in many an hour of
need, had learned to look up to Patrick Henry as
their strong and splendid champion, in the legislature
and in the courts. On the date just mentioned,
&#8220;the ministers and delegates of the Baptist
churches&#8221; of the State, being met in convention
at Louisa, sent to him this address:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">May it please your Excellency</span>,&mdash;As your advancement
to the honorable and important station as
governor of this commonwealth affords us unspeakable
pleasure, we beg leave to present your excellency with
our most cordial congratulations.<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>Your public virtues are such that we are under no
temptation to flatter you. Virginia has done honor to
her judgment in appointing your excellency to hold the
reins of government at this truly critical conjuncture,
as you have always distinguished yourself by your zeal
and activity for her welfare, in whatever department has
been assigned you.</p>

<p>As a religious community, we have nothing to request
of you. Your constant attachment to the glorious cause
of liberty and the rights of conscience, leaves us no
room to doubt of your excellency&#8217;s favorable regards
while we worthily demean ourselves.</p>

<p>May God Almighty continue you long, very long, a
public blessing to this your native country, and, after
a life of usefulness here, crown you with immortal felicity
in the world to come.</p>

<p class="sigtwo">Signed by order:<br />
<span class="smcap">Jeremiah Walker</span>, <i>Moderator</i>.<br />
<span class="smcap">John Williams</span>, <i>Clerk</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>To these loving and jubilant words, the governor
replied in an off-hand letter, the deep feeling
of which is not the less evident because it is restrained,&mdash;a
letter which is as choice and noble
in diction as it is in thought:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">TO THE MINISTERS AND DELEGATES OF THE BAPTIST
CHURCHES, AND THE MEMBERS OF THAT COMMUNION.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;I am exceedingly obliged to you for
your very kind address, and the favorable sentiments
you are pleased to entertain respecting my conduct and
the principles which have directed it. My constant endeavor
shall be to guard the rights of all my fellow-citizens
from every encroachment.<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>I am happy to find a catholic spirit prevailing in our
country, and that those religious distinctions, which
formerly produced some heats, are now forgotten.
Happy must every friend to virtue and America feel
himself, to perceive that the only contest among us, at
this most critical and important period, is, who shall be
foremost to preserve our religious and civil liberties.</p>

<p>My most earnest wish is, that Christian charity, forbearance,
and love, may unite all our different persuasions,
as brethren who must perish or triumph together;
and I trust that the time is not far distant when we
shall greet each other as the peaceable possessors of that
just and equal system of liberty adopted by the last convention,
and in support of which may God crown our
arms with success.</p>

<p>I am, gentlemen, your most obedient and very humble
servant,</p>

<p class="right1"><span class="smcap">P. Henry, Jun.</span><a name="FNanchor258" id="FNanchor258"></a><a href="#Footnote-258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>August 13, 1776.</p></div>

<p>On the day on which Governor Henry was sworn
into office, the convention finally adjourned, having
made provision for the meeting of the General
Assembly on the first Monday of the following October.
In the mean time, therefore, all the interests
of the State were to be in the immediate keeping
of the governor and privy council; and, for a
part of that time, as it turned out, the governor
himself was disabled for service. For we now encounter
in the history of Patrick Henry, the first
mention of that infirm health from which he seems
to have suffered, in some degree, during the remaining
twenty-three years of his life. Before
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
taking full possession of the governor&#8217;s palace,
which had to be made ready for his use, he had
likewise to prepare for this great change in his life
by returning to his home in the county of Hanover.
There he lay ill for some time;<a name="FNanchor259" id="FNanchor259"></a><a href="#Footnote-259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> and upon
his recovery he removed with his family to Williamsburg,
which continued to be their home for
the next three years.</p>

<p>The people of Virginia had been accustomed, for
more than a century, to look upon their governors
as personages of very great dignity. Several of
those governors had been connected with the English
peerage; all had served in Virginia in a vice-regal
capacity; many had lived there in a sort of
vice-regal pomp and magnificence. It is not to be
supposed that Governor Henry would be able or
willing to assume so much state and grandeur as
his predecessors had done; and yet he felt, and
the people of Virginia felt, that in the transition
from royal to republican forms the dignity of that
office should not be allowed to decline in any important
particular. Moreover, as a contemporary
observer mentions, Patrick Henry had been &#8220;accused
by the big-wigs of former times as being a
coarse and common man, and utterly destitute of
dignity; and perhaps he wished to show them that
they were mistaken.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor260" id="FNanchor260"></a><a href="#Footnote-260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> At any rate, by the testimony
of all, he seems to have displayed his usual
judgment and skill in adapting himself to the requirements
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
of his position; and, while never losing
his gentleness and his simplicity of manner, to
have borne himself as the impersonation, for the
time being, of the executive authority of a great and
proud commonwealth. He ceased to appear frequently
upon the streets; and whenever he did
appear, he was carefully arrayed in a dressed wig,
in black small-clothes, and in a scarlet cloak; and
his presence and demeanor were such as to sustain,
in the popular mind, the traditional respect for
his high office.</p>

<p>He had so far recovered from the illness which
had prostrated him during the summer, as to be
at his post of duty when the General Assembly
of the State began its first session, on Monday,
the 7th of October, 1776. His health, however,
was still extremely frail; for on the 30th of that
month he was obliged to notify the House &#8220;that
the low state of his health rendered him unable to
attend to the duties of his office, and that his physicians
had recommended to him to retire therefrom
into the country, till he should recover his
strength.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor261" id="FNanchor261"></a><a href="#Footnote-261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> His absence seems not to have been
very long. By the 16th of November, as one may
infer from entries in the journal of the House,<a name="FNanchor262" id="FNanchor262"></a><a href="#Footnote-262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> he
was able to resume his official duties.</p>

<p>The summer and autumn of that year proved to
be a dismal period for the American cause. Before
our eyes, as we now look back over those
days, there marches this grim procession of dates:<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
August 27, the battle of Long Island; August 29,
Washington&#8217;s retreat across East River; September
15, the panic among the American troops at
Kip&#8217;s Bay, and the American retreat from New
York; September 16, the battle of Harlem Plains;
September 20, the burning of New York; October
28, the battle of White Plains; November 16, the
surrender of Fort Washington; November 20, the
abandonment of Fort Lee, followed by Washington&#8217;s
retreat across the Jerseys. In the midst of
these disasters, Washington found time to write,
from the Heights of Harlem, on the 5th of October,
to his old friend, Patrick Henry, congratulating
him on his election as governor of Virginia
and on his recovery from sickness; explaining the
military situation at headquarters; advising him
about military appointments in Virginia; and especially
giving to him important suggestions concerning
the immediate military defence of Virginia
&#8220;against the enemy&#8217;s ships and tenders, which,&#8221;
as Washington says to the governor, &#8220;may go up
your rivers in quest of provisions, or for the purpose
of destroying your towns.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor263" id="FNanchor263"></a><a href="#Footnote-263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> Indeed, Virginia
was just then exposed to hostile attacks on
all sides;<a name="FNanchor264" id="FNanchor264"></a><a href="#Footnote-264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> and it was so plain that any attack by
water would have found an easy approach to Williamsburg,
that, in the course of the next few
months, the public records and the public stores
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
were removed to Richmond, as being, on every
account, a &#8220;more secure site.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor265" id="FNanchor265"></a><a href="#Footnote-265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Apparently, however,
the prompt recognition of this danger by
Governor Henry, early in the autumn of 1776,
and his vigorous military preparations against it,
were interpreted by some of his political enemies
as a sign both of personal cowardice and of official
self-glorification,&mdash;as is indicated by a letter written
by the aged Landon Carter to General Washington,
on the 31st of October, and filled with all
manner of caustic garrulity and insinuation,&mdash;a
letter from which it may be profitable for us to
quote a few sentences, as qualifying somewhat that
stream of honeyed testimony respecting Patrick
Henry which commonly flows down upon us so
copiously from all that period.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;If I don&#8217;t err in conjecture,&#8221; says Carter, &#8220;I can&#8217;t
help thinking that the head of our Commonwealth has
as great a palace of fear and apprehension as can possess
the heart of any being; and if we compare rumor with
actual movements, I believe it will prove itself to every
sensible man. As soon as the Congress sent for our
first, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth regiments to assist
you in contest against the enemy where they really were
&hellip; there got a report among the soldiery that Dignity
had declared it would not reside in Williamsburg without
two thousand men under arms to guard him. This
had like to have occasioned a mutiny. A desertion of
many from the several companies did follow; boisterous
fellows resisting, and swearing they would not leave their
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
county.&hellip; What a finesse of popularity was this?&hellip;
As soon as the regiments were gone, this great man
found an interest with the council of state, perhaps timorous
as himself, to issue orders for the militia of twenty-six
counties, and five companies of a minute battalion, to
march to Williamsburg, to protect him only against his
own fears; and to make this the more popular, it was
endeavored that the House of Delegates should give it a
countenance, but, as good luck would have it, it was
with difficulty refused.<a name="FNanchor266" id="FNanchor266"></a><a href="#Footnote-266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> &hellip; Immediately then, &hellip; a
bill is brought in to remove the seat of government,&mdash;some
say, up to Hanover, to be called Henry-Town.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor267" id="FNanchor267"></a><a href="#Footnote-267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p></div>

<p>This gossip of a disappointed Virginian aristocrat,
in vituperation of the public character of
Governor Henry, naturally leads us forward in
our story to that more stupendous eruption of gossip
which relates, in the first instance, to the latter
part of December, 1776, and which alleges that a
conspiracy was then formed among certain members
of the General Assembly to make Patrick
Henry the dictator of Virginia. The first intimation
ever given to the public concerning it, was
given by Jefferson several years afterward, in his
&#8220;Notes on Virginia,&#8221; a fascinating brochure which
was written by him in 1781 and 1782, was first
printed privately in Paris in 1784, and was first
published in England in 1787, in America in
1788.<a name="FNanchor268" id="FNanchor268"></a><a href="#Footnote-268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> The essential portions of his statement are
as follows:&mdash;<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;In December, 1776, our circumstances being much
distressed, it was proposed in the House of Delegates to
create a dictator, invested with every power legislative,
executive, and judiciary, civil and military, of life and
death, over our persons and over our properties.&hellip;
One who entered into this contest from a pure love of
liberty, and a sense of injured rights, who determined to
make every sacrifice and to meet every danger, for the
re&euml;stablishment of those rights on a firm basis, &hellip;
must stand confounded and dismayed when he is told
that a considerable portion of&#8221; the House &#8220;had meditated
the surrender of them into a single hand, and in
lieu of a limited monarchy, to deliver him over to a despotic
one.&hellip; The very thought alone was treason
against the people; was treason against man in general;
as riveting forever the chains which bow down their
necks, by giving to their oppressors a proof, which they
would have trumpeted through the universe, of the imbecility
of republican government, in times of pressing
danger, to shield them from harm.&hellip; Those who
meant well, of the advocates of this measure (and most
of them meant well, for I know them personally, had
been their fellow-laborer in the common cause, and had
often proved the purity of their principles), had been seduced
in their judgment by the example of an ancient
republic, whose constitution and circumstances were
fundamentally different.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor269" id="FNanchor269"></a><a href="#Footnote-269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p></div>

<p>With that artistic tact and that excellent prudence
which seem never to have failed Jefferson in
any of his enterprises for the disparagement of his
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
associates, he here avoids, as will be observed, all
mention of the name of the person for whose fatal
promotion this classic conspiracy was formed,&mdash;leaving
that interesting item to come out, as it did
many years afterward, when the most of those who
could have borne testimony upon the subject were
in their graves, and when the damning stigma
could be comfortably fastened to the name of Patrick
Henry without the direct intervention of Jefferson&#8217;s
own hands. Accordingly, in 1816, a
French gentleman, Girardin, a near neighbor of
Jefferson&#8217;s, who enjoyed &#8220;the incalculable benefit
of a free access to Mr. Jefferson&#8217;s library,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor270" id="FNanchor270"></a><a href="#Footnote-270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> and
who wrote the continuation of Burk&#8217;s &#8220;History of
Virginia&#8221; under Jefferson&#8217;s very eye,<a name="FNanchor271" id="FNanchor271"></a><a href="#Footnote-271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> gave in
that work a highly wrought account of the alleged
conspiracy of December, 1776, as involving &#8220;nothing
less than the substitution of a despotic in
lieu of a limited monarch;&#8221; and then proceeded
to bring the accusation down from those lurid
generalities of condemnation in which Jefferson
himself had cautiously left it, by adding this sentence:
&#8220;That Mr. Henry was the person in view
for the dictatorship, is well ascertained.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor272" id="FNanchor272"></a><a href="#Footnote-272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>Finally, in 1817, William Wirt, whose &#8220;Life
of Henry&#8221; was likewise composed under nearly
the same inestimable advantages as regards instruction
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
and oversight furnished by Jefferson,
repeated the fearful tale, and added some particulars;
but, in doing so, Wirt could not fail&mdash;good
lawyer and just man, as he was&mdash;to direct attention
to the absence of all evidence of any collusion
on the part of Patrick Henry with the projected
folly and crime.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Even the heroism of the Virginia legislature,&#8221; says
Wirt, &#8220;gave way; and, in a season of despair, the mad
project of a dictator was seriously meditated. That Mr.
Henry was thought of for this office, has been alleged,
and is highly probable; but that the project was suggested
by him, or even received his countenance, I have
met with no one who will venture to affirm. There is a
tradition that Colonel Archibald Cary, the speaker of the
Senate, was principally instrumental in crushing this project;
that meeting Colonel Syme, the step-brother of
Colonel Henry, in the lobby of the House, he accosted
him very fiercely in terms like these: &#8216;I am told that
your brother wishes to be dictator. Tell him from me,
that the day of his appointment shall be the day of his
death;&mdash;for he shall feel my dagger in his heart before
the sunset of that day.&#8217; And the tradition adds that
Colonel Syme, in great agitation, declared that &#8216;if such
a project existed, his brother had no hand in it; for that
nothing could be more foreign to him, than to countenance
any office which could endanger, in the most distant
manner, the liberties of his country.&#8217; The intrepidity
and violence of Colonel Cary&#8217;s character renders
the tradition probable; but it furnishes no proof of Mr.
Henry&#8217;s implication in the scheme.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor273" id="FNanchor273"></a><a href="#Footnote-273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
A disinterested study of this subject, in the
light of all the evidence now attainable, will be
likely to convince any one that this enormous scandal
must have been very largely a result of the
extreme looseness at that time prevailing in the
use of the word &#8220;dictator,&#8221; and of its being employed,
on the one side, in an innocent sense, and,
on the other side, in a guilty one. In strict propriety,
of course, the word designates a magistrate
created in an emergency of public peril, and clothed
for a time with unlimited power. It is an extreme
remedy, and in itself a remedy extremely dangerous,
and can never be innocently resorted to except
when the necessity for it is indubitable; and it
may well be questioned whether, among people
and institutions like our own, a necessity can ever
arise which would justify the temporary grant of
unlimited power to any man. If this be true, it
follows that no man among us can, without dire
political guilt, ever consent to bestow such power;
and that no man can, without the same guilt, ever
consent to receive it.</p>

<p>Yet it is plain that even among us, between the
years 1776 and 1783, emergencies of terrific public
peril did arise, sufficient to justify, nay, even to
compel, the bestowment either upon the governor
of some State, or upon the general of the armies,
not of unlimited power, certainly, but of extraordinary
power,&mdash;such extraordinary power, for
example, as was actually conferred by the Continental
Congress, more than once, on Washington;<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
as was conferred by the legislature of South Carolina
on Governor John Rutledge; as was repeatedly
conferred by the legislature of Virginia upon Governor
Patrick Henry; and afterward, in still higher
degree, by the same legislature, on Governor
Thomas Jefferson himself. Nevertheless, so loose
was the meaning then attached to the word &#8220;dictator,&#8221;
that it was not uncommon for men to speak
of these very cases as examples of the bestowment
of a dictatorship, and of the exercise of dictatorial
power; although, in every one of the cases mentioned,
there was lacking the essential feature of
a true dictatorship, namely, the grant of unlimited
power to one man. It is perfectly obvious, likewise,
that when, in those days, men spoke thus of
a dictatorship, and of dictatorial power, they attached
no suggestion of political guilt either to the
persons who bestowed such power, or to the persons
who severally accepted it,&mdash;the tacit understanding
being that, in every instance, the public
danger required and justified some grant of extraordinary
power; that no more power was granted
than was necessary; and that the man to whom,
in any case, the grant was made, was a man to
whom, there was good reason to believe, the grant
could be made with safety. Obviously, it was
upon this tacit understanding of its meaning that
the word was used, for instance, by Edmund Randolph,
in 1788, in the Virginia Constitutional
Convention, when, alluding to the extraordinary
power bestowed by Congress on Washington, he
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
said: &#8220;We had an American dictator in 1781.&#8221;
Surely, Randolph did not mean to impute political
crime, either to the Congress which made Washington
a dictator, or to Washington himself who
consented to be made one. It was upon the same
tacit understanding, also, that Patrick Henry, in
reply to Randolph, took up the word, and extolled
the grant of dictatorial power to Washington on
the occasion referred to: &#8220;In making a dictator,&#8221;
said Henry, &#8220;we followed the example of the most
glorious, magnanimous, and skilful nations. In
great dangers, this power has been given. Rome
has furnished us with an illustrious example.
America found a person for that trust: she looked
to Virginia for him. We gave a dictatorial power
to hands that used it gloriously, and which were
rendered more glorious by surrendering it up.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor274" id="FNanchor274"></a><a href="#Footnote-274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>Thus it is apparent that the word &#8220;dictator&#8221; was
frequently used in those times in a sense perfectly
innocent. As all men know, however, the word
is one capable of suggesting the possibilities of
dreadful political crime; and it is not hard to see
how, when employed by one person to describe
the bestowment and acceptance of extraordinary
power,&mdash;implying a perfectly innocent proposition,
it could be easily taken by another person as
describing the bestowment and acceptance of unlimited
power,&mdash;implying a proposition which
among us, probably, would always be a criminal
one.<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>With the help which this discussion may give
us, let us now return to the General Assembly of
Virginia, at Williamsburg, approaching the close
of its first session, in the latter part of December,
1776. It was on the point of adjourning, not to
meet again until the latter part of March, 1777.
At that moment, by the arrival of most alarming
news from the seat of war, it was forced to make
special provision for the public safety during the
interval which must elapse before its next session.
Its journal indicates that, prior to the 20th of
December, it had been proceeding with its business
in a quiet way, under no apparent consciousness
of imminent peril. On that day, however, there
are traces of a panic; for, on that day, &#8220;The Virginia
Gazette&#8221; announced to them the appalling
news of &#8220;the crossing of the Delaware by the British
forces, from twelve to fifteen thousand strong;
the position of General Washington, at Bristol, on
the south side of the river, with only six thousand
men;&#8221; and the virtual flight of Congress from
Philadelphia.<a name="FNanchor275" id="FNanchor275"></a><a href="#Footnote-275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> At this rate, how long would it
be before the Continental army would be dispersed
or captured, and the troops of the enemy sweeping
in vengeance across the borders of Virginia? Accordingly,
the House of Delegates immediately
resolved itself into &#8220;a committee to take into their
consideration the state of America;&#8221; but not being
able to reach any decision that day, it voted to
resume the subject on the day following, and for
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
that purpose to meet an hour earlier than usual.
So, on Saturday, the 21st of December, the House
passed a series of resolutions intended to provide
for the crisis into which the country was plunged,
and, among the other resolutions, this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;And whereas the present imminent danger of America,
and the ruin and misery which threatens the good
people of this Commonwealth, and their posterity, calls
for the utmost exertion of our strength, and it is become
necessary for the preservation of the State that the usual
forms of government be suspended during a limited time,
for the more speedy execution of the most vigorous and
effectual measures to repel the invasion of the enemy;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Resolved, therefore</i>, That the governor be, and he is
hereby fully authorized and empowered, by and with
the advice and consent of the privy council, from henceforward,
until ten days next after the first meeting of
the General Assembly, to carry into execution such requisitions
as may be made to this Commonwealth by the
American Congress for the purpose of encountering or
repelling the enemy; to order the three battalions on the
pay of this Commonwealth to march, if necessary, to join
the Continental army, or to the assistance of any of our
sister States; to call forth any and such greater military
force as they shall judge requisite, either by embodying
and arraying companies or regiments of volunteers, or
by raising additional battalions, appointing and commissioning
the proper officers, and to direct their operations
within this Commonwealth, under the command of
the Continental generals or other officers according to
their respective ranks, or order them to march to join
and act in concert with the Continental army, or the
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
troops of any of the American States; and to provide
for their pay, supply of provisions, arms, and other
necessaries, at the charge of this Commonwealth, by
drawing on the treasurer for the money which may be
necessary from time to time; and the said treasurer is
authorized to pay such warrants out of any public
money which may be in his hands, and the General Assembly
will, at their next session, make ample provision
for any deficiency which may happen. But that this
departure from the constitution of government, being
in this instance founded only on the most evident and
urgent necessity, ought not hereafter to be drawn into
precedent.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>These resolutions, having been pressed rapidly
through the forms of the House, were at once
carried up to the Senate for its concurrence. The
answer of the Senate was promptly returned, agreeing
to all the resolutions of the lower House, but
proposing an important amendment in the phraseology
of the particular resolution which we have
just quoted. Instead of this clause&mdash;&#8220;the usual
forms of government should be suspended,&#8221; it suggested
the far more accurate and far more prudent
expression which here follows,&mdash;&#8220;additional powers
be given to the governor and council.&#8221; This
amendment was assented to by the House; and
almost immediately thereafter it adjourned until
the last Thursday in March, 1777, &#8220;then to meet
in the city of Williamsburg, or at such other place
as the governor and council, for good reasons, may
appoint.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor276" id="FNanchor276"></a><a href="#Footnote-276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p><span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
Such, undoubtedly, was the occasion on which,
if at any time during that session, the project for
a dictatorship in Virginia was under consideration
by the House of Delegates. The only evidence
for the reality of such a project is derived from
the testimony of Jefferson; and Jefferson, though
a member of the House, was not then in attendance,
having procured, on the 29th of the previous
month, permission to be absent during the
remainder of the session.<a name="FNanchor277" id="FNanchor277"></a><a href="#Footnote-277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> Is it not probable that
the whole terrible plot, as it afterward lay in the
mind of Jefferson, may have originated in reports
which reached him elsewhere, to the effect that, in
the excitement of the House over the public danger
and over the need of energetic measures against
that danger, some members had demanded that
the governor should be invested with what they
perhaps called dictatorial power, meaning thereby
no more than extraordinary power; and that all
the criminal accretions to that meaning, which
Jefferson attributed to the project, were simply
the work of his own imagination, always sensitive
and quick to take alarm on behalf of human liberty,
and, on such a subject as this, easily set on
fire by examples of awful political crime which
would occur to him from Roman history? This
suggestion, moreover, is not out of harmony with
one which has been made by a thorough and most
candid student of the subject, who says: &#8220;I am
very much inclined to think that some sneering
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
remark of Colonel Cary, on that occasion, has
given rise to the whole story about a proposed
dictator at that time.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor278" id="FNanchor278"></a><a href="#Footnote-278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>At any rate, this must not be forgotten: if the
project of a dictatorship, in the execrable sense
affirmed by Jefferson, was, during that session,
advocated by any man or by any cabal in the Assembly,
history must absolve Patrick Henry of all
knowledge of it, and of all responsibility for it.
Not only has no tittle of evidence been produced,
involving his connivance at such a scheme, but the
Assembly itself, a few months later, unwittingly
furnished to posterity the most conclusive proof
that no man in that body could have believed him
to be smirched with even the suggestion of so horrid
a crime. Had Patrick Henry been suspected,
during the autumn and early winter of 1776, of
any participation in the foul plot to create a despotism
in Virginia, is it to be conceived that, at its
very next session, in the spring of 1777, that Assembly,
composed of nearly the same members as
before, would have re&euml;lected to the governorship
so profligate and dangerous a man, and that too
without any visible opposition in either House?
Yet that is precisely what the Virginia Assembly
did in May, 1777. Moreover, one year later, this
same Assembly re&euml;lected this same profligate and
dangerous politician for his third and last permissible
year in the governorship, and it did so with
the same unbroken unanimity. Moreover, during
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
all that time, Thomas Jefferson was a member,
and a most conspicuous and influential member,
of the Virginia Assembly. If, indeed, he then
believed that his old friend, Patrick Henry, had
stood ready in 1776, to commit &#8220;treason against
the people&#8221; of America, and &#8220;treason against
mankind in general,&#8221; why did he permit the traitor
to be twice re&euml;lected to the chief magistracy, without
the record of even one brave effort against him
on either occasion?</p>

<p>On the 26th of December, 1776, in accordance
with the special authority thus conferred upon him
by the General Assembly, Governor Henry issued a
vigorous proclamation, declaring that the &#8220;critical
situation of American affairs&#8221; called for &#8220;the
utmost exertion of every sister State to put a
speedy end to the cruel ravages of a haughty and
inveterate enemy, and secure our invaluable rights,&#8221;
and &#8220;earnestly exhorting and requiring&#8221; all the
good people of Virginia to assist in the formation
of volunteer companies for such service as might
be required.<a name="FNanchor279" id="FNanchor279"></a><a href="#Footnote-279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> The date of that proclamation was
also the date of Washington&#8217;s famous matutinal
surprise of the Hessians at Trenton,&mdash;a bit of
much-needed good luck, which was followed by
his fortunate engagement with the enemy near
Princeton, on the 3d of January, 1777. On these
and a very few other extremely small crumbs of
comfort, the struggling revolutionists had to nourish
their burdened hearts for many a month thereafter;<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
Washington himself, during all that time,
with his little army of tattered and barefoot warriors,
majestically predominating over the scene
from the heights of Morristown; while the good-humored
British commander, Sir William Howe,
considerately abstained from any serious military
disturbance until the middle of the following summer.
Thus the chief duty of the governor of Virginia,
during the winter and spring of 1777, as it
had been in the previous autumn, was that of trying
to keep in the field Virginia&#8217;s quota of troops,
and of trying to furnish Virginia&#8217;s share of military
supplies,&mdash;no easy task, it should seem, in
those times of poverty, confusion, and patriotic
languor. The official correspondence of the governor
indicates the unslumbering anxiety, the energy,
the fertility of device with which, in spite
of defective health, he devoted himself to these
hard tasks.<a name="FNanchor280" id="FNanchor280"></a><a href="#Footnote-280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>In his great desire for exact information as to
the real situation at headquarters, Governor Henry
had sent to Washington a secret messenger by
the name of Walker, who was to make his observations
at Morristown and to report the results to
himself. Washington at once perceived the embarrassments
to which such a plan might lead;
and accordingly, on the 24th of February, 1777,<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
he wrote to the governor, gently explaining why
he could not receive Mr. Walker as a mere visiting
observer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;To avoid the precedent, therefore, and from your
character of Mr. Walker, and the high opinion I myself
entertain of his abilities, honor, and prudence, I have
taken him into my family as an extra aide-de-camp, and
shall be happy if, in this character, he can answer your
expectations. I sincerely thank you, sir, for your kind
congratulations on the late success of the Continental
arms (would to God it may continue), and for your polite
mention of me. Let me earnestly entreat that the
troops raised in Virginia for this army be forwarded on
by companies, or otherwise, without delay, and as well
equipped as possible for the field, or we shall be in no
condition to open the campaign.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor281" id="FNanchor281"></a><a href="#Footnote-281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p></div>

<p>On the 29th of the following month, the governor
wrote to Washington of the overwhelming
difficulty attending all his efforts to comply with
the request mentioned in the letter just cited:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;I am very sorry to inform you that the recruiting
business of late goes on so badly, that there remains but
little prospect of filling the six new battalions from this
State, voted by the Assembly. The Board of Council
see this with great concern, and, after much reflection
on the subject, are of opinion that the deficiency in our
regulars can no way be supplied so properly as by enlisting
volunteers. There is reason to believe a considerable
number of these may be got to serve six or eight
months.&hellip; I believe you can receive no assistance by
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
drafts from the militia. From the battalions of the
Commonwealth none can be drawn as yet, because they
are not half full.&hellip; Virginia will find some apology
with you for this deficiency in her quota of regulars,
when the difficulties lately thrown in our way are considered.
The Georgians and Carolinians have enlisted
[in Virginia] probably two battalions at least. A regiment
of artillery is in great forwardness. Besides these,
Colonels Baylor and Grayson are collecting regiments;
and three others are forming for this State. Add to all
this our Indian wars and marine service, almost total
want of necessaries, the false accounts of deserters,&mdash;many
of whom lurk here,&mdash;the terrors of the smallpox
and the many deaths occasioned by it, and the deficient
enlistments are accounted for in the best manner I
can. As no time can be spared, I wish to be honored
with your answer as soon as possible, in order to promote
the volunteer scheme, if it meets your approbation.
I should be glad of any improvements on it that may
occur to you. I believe about four of the six battalions
may be enlisted, but have seen no regular [return] of
their state. Their scattered situation, and being many
of them in broken quotas, is a reason for their slow
movement. I have issued repeated orders for their
march long since.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor282" id="FNanchor282"></a><a href="#Footnote-282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p></div>

<p>The General Assembly of Virginia, at its session
in the spring of 1777, was required to elect a governor,
to serve for one year from the day on which
that session should end. As no candidate was
named in opposition to Patrick Henry, the Senate
proposed to the House of Delegates that he should
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
be reappointed without ballot. This, accordingly,
was done, by resolution of the latter body on the
29th of May, and by that of the Senate on the
1st of June. On the 5th of June, the committee
appointed to inform the governor of this action
laid before the House his answer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;The signal honor conferred on me
by the General Assembly, in their choice of me to be
governor of this Commonwealth, demands my best acknowledgments,
which I beg the favor of you to convey
to them in the most acceptable manner.</p>

<p>I shall execute the duties of that high station to which
I am again called by the favor of my fellow-citizens,
according to the best of my abilities, and I shall rely
upon the candor and wisdom of the Assembly to excuse
and supply my defects. The good of the Commonwealth
shall be the only object of my pursuit, and I shall measure
my happiness according to the success which shall
attend my endeavors to establish the public liberty. I
beg to be presented to the Assembly, and that they and
you will be assured that I am, with every sentiment of
the highest regard, their and your most obedient and
very humble servant,</p>

<p class="right1"><span class="smcap">P. Henry.</span><a name="FNanchor283" id="FNanchor283"></a><a href="#Footnote-283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>
</div>

<p>After a perusal of this nobly written letter, the
gentle reader will have no difficulty in concluding
that, if indeed the author of it was then lying in
wait for an opportunity to set up a despotism in
Virginia, he had already become an adept in the
hypocrisy which enabled him, not only to conceal
the fact, but to convey an impression quite the
opposite.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV <br />
<span class="hsub">GOVERNOR A SECOND TIME</span></h2>


<p>Patrick Henry&#8217;s second term as governor extended
from the 28th of June, 1777, to the 28th of
June, 1778: a twelvemonth of vast and even decisive
events in the struggle for national independence,&mdash;its
awful disasters being more than
relieved by the successes, both diplomatic and military,
which were compressed within that narrow
strip of time. Let us try, by a glance at the chief
items in the record of that year, to bring before
our eyes the historic environment amid which the
governor of Virginia then wrought at his heavy
tasks: July 6, 1777, American evacuation of Ticonderoga
at the approach of Burgoyne; August 6,
defeat of Herkimer by the British under St. Leger;
August 16, Stark&#8217;s victory over the British at Bennington;
September 11, defeat of Washington at
Brandywine; September 27, entrance of the British
into Philadelphia; October 4, defeat of Washington
at Germantown; October 16, surrender of
Burgoyne and his entire army; December 11,
Washington&#8217;s retirement into winter quarters at
Valley Forge; February 6, 1778, American treaty
of alliance with France; May 11, death of Lord
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Chatham; June 13, Lord North&#8217;s peace commissioners
propose to Congress a cessation of hostilities;
June 18, the British evacuate Philadelphia;
June 28, the battle of Monmouth.</p>

<p>The story of the personal life of Patrick Henry
during those stern and agitating months is lighted
up by the mention of his marriage, on the 9th
of October, 1777, to Dorothea Dandridge, a granddaughter
of the old royal governor, Alexander
Spotswood,&mdash;a lady who was much younger than
her husband, and whose companionship proved to
be the solace of all the years that remained to him
on earth.</p>

<p>The pressure of official business upon him can
hardly have been less than during the previous
year. The General Assembly was in session from
the 20th of October, 1777, until the 24th of January,
1778, and from the 4th of May to the 1st of
June, 1778,&mdash;involving, of course, a long strain
of attention by the governor to the work of the two
houses. Moreover, the prominence of Virginia
among the States, and, at the same time, her exemption
from the most formidable assaults of the
enemy, led to great demands being made upon her
both for men and for supplies. To meet these
demands, either by satisfying them or by explaining
his failure to do so, involved a copious and
laborious correspondence on the part of Governor
Henry, not only with his own official subordinates
in the State, but with the president of Congress,
with the board of war, and with the general of the
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
army. The official letters which he thus wrote are
a monument of his ardor and energy as a war governor,
his attention to details, his broad practical
sense, his hopefulness and patience under galling
disappointments and defeats.<a name="FNanchor284" id="FNanchor284"></a><a href="#Footnote-284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps nothing in the life of Governor Henry
during his second term of office has so touching an
interest for us now, as has the course which he
took respecting the famous intrigue, which was developed
into alarming proportions during the winter
of 1777 and 1778, for the displacement of
Washington, and for the elevation of the shallow
and ill-balanced Gates to the supreme command of
the armies. It is probable that several men of
prominence in the army, in Congress, and in the
several state governments, were drawn into this
cabal, although most of them had too much caution
to commit themselves to it by any documentary
evidence which could rise up and destroy them in
case of its failure. The leaders in the plot very
naturally felt the great importance of securing the
secret support of men of high influence in Washington&#8217;s
own State; and by many it was then believed
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
that they had actually won over no less a
man than Richard Henry Lee. Of course, if also
the sanction of Governor Patrick Henry could be
secured, a prodigious advantage would be gained.
Accordingly, from the town of York, in Pennsylvania,
whither Congress had fled on the advance of
the enemy towards Philadelphia, the following letter
was sent to him,&mdash;a letter written in a disguised
hand, without signature, but evidently by a
personal friend, a man of position, and a master of
the art of plausible statement:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right1"><span class="smcap">Yorktown</span>, 12 January, 1778.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The common danger of our country
first brought you and me together. I recollect with
pleasure the influence of your conversation and eloquence
upon the opinions of this country in the beginning
of the present controversy. You first taught us to
shake off our idolatrous attachment to royalty, and to
oppose its encroachments upon our liberties with our
very lives. By these means you saved us from ruin.
The independence of America is the offspring of that
liberal spirit of thinking and acting, which followed the
destruction of the sceptres of kings, and the mighty
power of Great Britain.</p>

<p>But, Sir, we have only passed the Red Sea. A
dreary wilderness is still before us; and unless a Moses
or a Joshua are raised up in our behalf, we must perish
before we reach the promised land. We have nothing
to fear from our enemies on the way. General Howe,
it is true, has taken Philadelphia, but he has only
changed his prison. His dominions are bounded on all
sides by his out-sentries. America can only be undone
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
by herself. She looks up to her councils and arms for
protection; but, alas! what are they? Her representation
in Congress dwindled to only twenty-one members;
her Adams, her Wilson, her Henry are no more among
them. Her councils weak, and partial remedies applied
constantly for universal diseases. Her army, what is
it? A major-general belonging to it called it a few
days ago, in my hearing, a mob. Discipline unknown
or wholly neglected. The quartermaster&#8217;s and commissary&#8217;s
departments filled with idleness, ignorance, and
peculation; our hospitals crowded with six thousand
sick, but half provided with necessaries or accommodations,
and more dying in them in one month than perished
in the field during the whole of the last campaign.
The money depreciating, without any effectual measures
being taken to raise it; the country distracted with the
Don Quixote attempts to regulate the price of provisions;
an artificial famine created by it, and a real one
dreaded from it; the spirit of the people failing through
a more intimate acquaintance with the causes of our
misfortunes; many submitting daily to General Howe;
and more wishing to do it, only to avoid the calamities
which threaten our country. But is our case desperate?
By no means. We have wisdom, virtue and strength
enough to save us, if they could be called into action.
The northern army has shown us what Americans are
capable of doing with a General at their head. The
spirit of the southern army is no way inferior to the
spirit of the northern. A Gates, a Lee, or a Conway,
would in a few weeks render them an irresistible body
of men. The last of the above officers has accepted of
the new office of inspector-general of our army, in order
to reform abuses; but the remedy is only a palliative
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
one. In one of his letters to a friend he says, &#8216;A great
and good God hath decreed America to be free, or the
[General] and weak counsellors would have ruined her
long ago.&#8217; You may rest assured of each of the facts
related in this letter. The author of it is one of your
Philadelphia friends. A hint of his name, if found out
by the handwriting, must not be mentioned to your most
intimate friend. Even the letter must be thrown into the
fire. But some of its contents ought to be made public,
in order to awaken, enlighten, and alarm our country.
I rely upon your prudence, and am, dear Sir, with my
usual attachment to you, and to our beloved independence,</p>

<p class="right1">Yours sincerely.</p>

</div>

<p>How was Patrick Henry to deal with such a letter
as this? Even though he should reject its reasoning,
and spurn the temptation with which it
assailed him, should he merely burn it, and be
silent? The incident furnished a fair test of his
loyalty in friendship, his faith in principle, his
soundness of judgment, his clear and cool grasp of
the public situation,&mdash;in a word, of his manliness
and his statesmanship. This is the way in which
he stood the test:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">PATRICK HENRY TO GEORGE WASHINGTON.</p>

<p class="right1"><span class="smcap">Williamsburg</span>, 20 February, 1778.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;You will, no doubt, be surprised at
seeing the enclosed letter, in which the encomiums bestowed
on me are as undeserved, as the censures aimed
at you are unjust. I am sorry there should be one man
who counts himself my friend, who is not yours.<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps I give you needless trouble in handing you
this paper. The writer of it may be too insignificant to
deserve any notice. If I knew this to be the case, I
should not have intruded on your time, which is so precious.
But there may possibly be some scheme or party
forming to your prejudice. The enclosed leads to such
a suspicion. Believe, me, Sir, I have too high a sense
of the obligations America has to you, to abet or countenance
so unworthy a proceeding. The most exalted
merit has ever been found to attract envy. But I please
myself with the hope that the same fortitude and greatness
of mind, which have hitherto braved all the difficulties
and dangers inseparable from your station, will
rise superior to every attempt of the envious partisan.
I really cannot tell who is the writer of this letter, which
not a little perplexes me. The handwriting is altogether
strange to me.</p>

<p>To give you the trouble of this gives me pain. It
would suit my inclination better to give you some assistance
in the great business of the war. But I will not conceal
anything from you, by which you may be affected;
for I really think your personal welfare and the happiness
of America are intimately connected. I beg you
will be assured of that high regard and esteem with
which I ever am, dear sir, your affectionate friend and
very humble servant.</p>
</div>

<p>Fifteen days passed after the dispatch of that
letter, when, having as yet no answer, but with a
heart still full of anxiety respecting this mysterious
and ill-boding cabal against his old friend, Governor
Henry wrote again:&mdash;<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">PATRICK HENRY TO GEORGE WASHINGTON.</p>

<p class="right1"><span class="smcap">Williamsburg</span>, 5 March, 1778.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;By an express, which Colonel Finnie
sent to camp, I enclosed to you an anonymous letter
which I hope got safe to hand. I am anxious to hear
something that will serve to explain the strange affair,
which I am now informed is taken up respecting you.
Mr. Custis has just paid us a visit, and by him I learn
sundry particulars concerning General Mifflin, that much
surprised me. It is very hard to trace the schemes and
windings of the enemies to America. I really thought
that man its friend; however, I am too far from him to
judge of his present temper.</p>

<p>While you face the armed enemies of our liberty in
the field, and by the favor of God have been kept unhurt,
I trust your country will never harbor in her bosom
the miscreant, who would ruin her best supporter. I
wish not to flatter; but when arts, unworthy honest men,
are used to defame and traduce you, I think it not
amiss, but a duty, to assure you of that estimation in
which the public hold you. Not that I think any testimony
I can bear is necessary for your support, or private
satisfaction; for a bare recollection of what is past
must give you sufficient pleasure in every circumstance
of life. But I cannot help assuring you, on this occasion,
of the high sense of gratitude which all ranks of
men in this our native country bear to you. It will give
me sincere pleasure to manifest my regards, and render
my best services to you or yours. I do not like to make
a parade of these things, and I know you are not fond
of it; however, I hope the occasion will plead my excuse.
Wishing you all possible felicity, I am, my dear
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
Sir, your ever affectionate friend and very humble servant.</p>
</div>

<p>Before Washington received this second letter,
he had already begun to write the following reply
to the first:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">GEORGE WASHINGTON TO PATRICK HENRY.</p>

<p class="right1"><span class="smcap">Valley Forge</span>, 27 March, 1778.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;About eight days ago I was honored
with your favor of the 20th ultimo. Your friendship,
sir, in transmitting to me the anonymous letter you had
received, lays me under the most grateful obligations,
and if my acknowledgments can be due for anything
more, it is for the polite and delicate terms in which
you have been pleased to communicate the matter.</p>

<p>I have ever been happy in supposing that I had a
place in your esteem, and the proof you have afforded
on this occasion makes me peculiarly so. The favorable
light in which you hold me is truly flattering; but I
should feel much regret, if I thought the happiness of
America so intimately connected with my personal welfare,
as you so obligingly seem to consider it. All I can
say is, that she has ever had, and I trust she ever will
have, my honest exertions to promote her interest. I
cannot hope that my services have been the best; but
my heart tells me they have been the best that I could
render.</p>

<p>That I may have erred in using the means in my
power for accomplishing the objects of the arduous, exalted
station with which I am honored, I cannot doubt;
nor do I wish my conduct to be exempted from reprehension
farther than it may deserve. Error is the portion
of humanity, and to censure it, whether committed
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
by this or that public character, is the prerogative of
freemen. However, being intimately acquainted with
the man I conceive to be the author of the letter transmitted,
and having always received from him the strongest
professions of attachment and regard, I am constrained
to consider him as not possessing, at least, a
great degree of candor and sincerity, though his views
in addressing you should have been the result of conviction,
and founded in motives of public good. This is
not the only secret, insidious attempt that has been
made to wound my reputation. There have been others
equally base, cruel, and ungenerous, because conducted
with as little frankness, and proceeding from views, perhaps,
as personally interested. I am, dear sir, with
great esteem and regard, your much obliged friend, etc.</p>
</div>

<p>The writing of the foregoing letter was not
finished, when Governor Henry&#8217;s second letter
reached him; and this additional proof of friendship
so touched the heart of Washington that, on
the next day, he wrote again, this time with far
less self-restraint than before:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">GEORGE WASHINGTON TO PATRICK HENRY</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp</span>, 28 March, 1778.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Just as I was about to close my letter
of yesterday, your favor of the 5th instant came to
hand. I can only thank you again, in the language of
the most undissembled gratitude, for your friendship;
and assure you, that the indulgent disposition, which
Virginia in particular, and the States in general, entertain
towards me, gives me the most sensible pleasure.
The approbation of my country is what I wish; and as
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
far as my abilities and opportunities will permit, I hope
I shall endeavor to deserve it. It is the highest reward
to a feeling mind; and happy are they, who so conduct
themselves as to merit it.</p>

<p>The anonymous letter with which you were pleased
to favor me, was written by Dr. Rush, so far as I can
judge from a similitude of hands. This man has been
elaborate and studied in his professions of regard for
me; and long since the letter to you. My caution to
avoid anything which could injure the service, prevented
me from communicating, but to a very few of
my friends, the intrigues of a faction which I know was
formed against me, since it might serve to publish our
internal dissensions; but their own restless zeal to advance
their views has too clearly betrayed them, and
made concealment on my part fruitless. I cannot precisely
mark the extent of their views, but it appeared,
in general, that General Gates was to be exalted on the
ruin of my reputation and influence. This I am authorized
to say, from undeniable facts in my own possession,
from publications, the evident scope of which
could not be mistaken, and from private detractions industriously
circulated. General Mifflin, it is commonly
supposed, bore the second part in the cabal; and General
Conway, I know, was a very active and malignant
partisan; but I have good reason to believe that their
machinations have recoiled most sensibly upon themselves.
With sentiments of great esteem and regard,
I am, dear sir, your affectionate humble servant.<a name="FNanchor285" id="FNanchor285"></a><a href="#Footnote-285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This incident in the lives of Washington and
Patrick Henry is to be noted by us, not only for
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
its own exquisite delicacy and nobility, but likewise
as the culminating fact in the growth of a
very deep and true friendship between the two
men,&mdash;a friendship which seems to have begun
many years before, probably in the House of Burgesses,
and which lasted with increasing strength
and tenderness, and with but a single episode of
estrangement, during the rest of their lives.
Moreover, he who tries to interpret the later career
of Patrick Henry, especially after the establishment
of the government under the Constitution,
and who leaves out of the account Henry&#8217;s profound
friendship for Washington, and the basis
of moral and intellectual congeniality on which
that friendship rested, will lose an important clew
to the perfect naturalness and consistency of
Henry&#8217;s political course during his last years. A
fierce partisan outcry was then raised against him
in Virginia, and he was bitterly denounced as a
political apostate, simply because, in the parting
of the ways of Washington and of Jefferson, Patrick
Henry no longer walked with Jefferson. In
truth, Patrick Henry was never Washington&#8217;s follower
nor Jefferson&#8217;s: he was no man&#8217;s follower.
From the beginning, he had always done for himself
his own thinking, whether right or wrong.
At the same time, a careful student of the three
men may see that, in his thinking, Patrick Henry
had a closer and a truer moral kinship with Washington
than with Jefferson. At present, however,
we pause before the touching incident that has just
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
been narrated in the relations between Washington
and Henry, in order to mark its bearing on their
subsequent intercourse. Washington, in whose
nature confidence was a plant of slow growth, and
who was quick neither to love nor to cease from
loving, never forgot that proof of his friend&#8217;s
friendship. Thenceforward, until that one year in
which they both died, the letters which passed between
them, while never effusive, were evidently
the letters of two strong men who loved and
trusted each other without reserve.</p>

<p>Not long before the close of the governor&#8217;s
second term in office, he had occasion to write to
Richard Henry Lee two letters, which are of considerable
interest, not only as indicating the cordial
intimacy between these two great rivals in
oratory, but also for the light they throw both
on the under-currents of bitterness then ruffling
the politics of Virginia, and on Patrick Henry&#8217;s
attitude towards the one great question at that
time uppermost in the politics of the nation. During
the previous autumn, it seems, also, Lee had
fallen into great disfavor in Virginia, from which
he had so far emerged by the 23d of January,
1778, as to be then re&euml;lected to Congress, to fill
out an unexpired term.<a name="FNanchor286" id="FNanchor286"></a><a href="#Footnote-286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> Shortly afterward, however,
harsh speech against him was to be heard in
Virginia once more, of which his friend, the governor,
thus informed him, in a letter dated April 4,
1778:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>

<p>&#8220;You are again traduced by a certain set who have
drawn in others, who say that you are engaged in a
scheme to discard General Washington. I know you
too well to suppose that you would engage in anything
not evidently calculated to serve the cause of whiggism.&hellip;
But it is your fate to suffer the constant attacks of
disguised Tories who take this measure to lessen you.
Farewell, my dear friend. In praying for your welfare,
I pray for that of my country, to which your life and
service are of the last moment.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor287" id="FNanchor287"></a><a href="#Footnote-287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p></div>

<p>Furthermore, on the 30th of May, the General
Assembly made choice of their delegates in Congress
for the following year. Lee was again
elected, but by so small a vote that his name stood
next to the lowest on the list.<a name="FNanchor288" id="FNanchor288"></a><a href="#Footnote-288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Concerning this
stinging slight, he appears to have spoken in his
next letters to the governor; for, on the 18th of
June, the latter addressed to him, from Williamsburg,
this reply:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Both your last letters came to
hand to-day. I felt for you, on seeing the order in
which the balloting placed the delegates in Congress.
It is an effect of that rancorous malice that has so long
followed you, through that arduous path of duty which
you have invariably travelled, since America resolved to
resist her oppressors.</p>

<p>Is it any pleasure to you to remark, that at the same
era in which these men figure against you, public spirit
seems to have taken its flight from Virginia? It is too
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
much the case; for the quota of our troops is not half
made up, and no chance seems to remain for completing
it. The Assembly voted three hundred and fifty horse,
and two thousand men, to be forthwith raised, and to
join the grand army. Great bounties are offered; but,
I fear, the only effect will be to expose our state to contempt,&mdash;for
I believe no soldiers will enlist, especially
in the infantry.</p>

<p>Can you credit it?&mdash;no effort was made for supporting
or restoring public credit. I pressed it warmly on
some, but in vain. This is the reason we get no soldiers.</p>

<p>We shall issue fifty or sixty thousand dollars in cash
to equip the cavalry, and their time is to expire at
Christmas. I believe they will not be in the field before
that time.</p>

<p>Let not Congress rely on Virginia for soldiers. I
tell you my opinion: they will not be got here, until a
different spirit prevails.</p></div>

<p>In the next paragraph of his letter, the governor
passes from these local matters to what was
then the one commanding topic in national affairs.
Lord North&#8217;s peace commissioners had already arrived,
and were seeking to win back the Americans
into free colonial relations with the mother country,
and away from their new-formed friendship
with perfidious France. With what energy Patrick
Henry was prepared to reject all these British
blandishments, may be read in the passionate sentences
which conclude his letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I look at the past condition of America, as at a
dreadful precipice, from which we have escaped by
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
means of the generous French, to whom I will be ever-lastingly
bound by the most heartfelt gratitude. But I
must mistake matters, if some of those men who traduce
you, do not prefer the offers of Britain. You will have
a different game to play now with the commissioners.
How comes Governor Johnstone there? I do not see
how it comports with his past life.</p>

<p>Surely Congress will never recede from our French
friends. Salvation to America depends upon our holding
fast our attachment to them. I shall date our ruin
from the moment that it is exchanged for anything
Great Britain can say, or do. She can never be cordial
with us. Baffled, defeated, disgraced by her colonies,
she will ever meditate revenge. We can find no safety
but in her ruin, or, at least, in her extreme humiliation;
which has not happened, and cannot happen, until she
is deluged with blood, or thoroughly purged by a revolution,
which shall wipe from existence the present king
with his connections, and the present system with those
who aid and abet it.</p>

<p>For God&#8217;s sake, my dear sir, quit not the councils of
your country, until you see us forever disjoined from
Great Britain. The old leaven still works. The fleshpots
of Egypt are still savory to degenerate palates.
Again we are undone, if the French alliance is not religiously
observed. Excuse my freedom. I know your
love to our country,&mdash;and this is my motive. May
Heaven give you health and prosperity.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="right3">I am yours affectionately,<br /></span>
<span class="right1"><span class="smcap">Patrick Henry.</span><a name="FNanchor289" id="FNanchor289"></a><a href="#Footnote-289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Before coming to the end of our story of Governor
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
Henry&#8217;s second term, it should be mentioned
that twice during this period did the General Assembly
confide to him those extraordinary powers
which by many were spoken of as dictatorial; first,
on the 22d of January, 1778,<a name="FNanchor290" id="FNanchor290"></a><a href="#Footnote-290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> and again, on the
28th of May, of the same year.<a name="FNanchor291" id="FNanchor291"></a><a href="#Footnote-291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> Finally, so safe
had been this great trust in his hands, and so efficiently
had he borne himself, in all the labors and
responsibilities of his high office, that, on the 29th
of May, the House of Delegates, by resolution,
unanimously elected him as governor for a third
term,&mdash;an act in which, on the same day, the
Senate voted its concurrence. On the 30th of
May, Thomas Jefferson, from the committee appointed
to notify the governor of his re&euml;lection, reported
to the House the following answer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;The General Assembly, in again electing
me governor of this commonwealth, have done me
very signal honor. I trust that their confidence, thus
continued in me, will not be misplaced. I beg you
will be pleased, gentlemen, to present me to the General
Assembly in terms of grateful acknowledgment for
this fresh instance of their favor towards me; and to
assure them, that my best endeavors shall be used to
promote the public good, in that station to which they
have once more been pleased to call me.<a name="FNanchor292" id="FNanchor292"></a><a href="#Footnote-292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XV <br />
<span class="hsub">THIRD YEAR IN THE GOVERNORSHIP</span></h2>


<p>Governor Henry&#8217;s third official year was
marked, in the great struggle then in progress, by
the arrival of the French fleet, and by its futile
attempts to be of any use to those hard-pressed
rebels whom the king of France had undertaken
to encourage in their insubordination; by awful
scenes of carnage and desolation in the outlying
settlements at Wyoming, Cherry Valley, and Schoharie;
by British predatory expeditions along the
Connecticut coast; by the final failure and departure
of Lord North&#8217;s peace commissioners; and by
the transfer of the chief seat of war to the South,
beginning with the capture of Savannah by the
British on the 29th of December, 1778, followed
by their initial movement on Charleston, in May,
1779. In the month just mentioned, likewise, the
enemy, under command of General Matthews and
of Sir George Collier, suddenly swooped down on
Virginia, first seizing Portsmouth and Norfolk,
and then, after a glorious military debauch of robbery,
ruin, rape, and murder, and after spreading
terror and anguish among the undefended populations
of Suffolk, Kemp&#8217;s Landing, Tanner&#8217;s Creek,<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
and Gosport, as suddenly gathered up their booty,
and went back in great glee to New York.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1778, the governor had the
happiness to hear of the really brilliant success of
the expedition which, with statesmanlike sagacity,
he had sent out under George Rogers Clark, into
the Illinois country, in the early part of the year.<a name="FNanchor293" id="FNanchor293"></a><a href="#Footnote-293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>
Some of the more important facts connected with
this expedition, he thus announced to the Virginia
delegates in Congress:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right1"><span class="smcap">Williamsburg</span>, November 14, 1778.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;The executive power of this State
having been impressed with a strong apprehension of
incursions on the frontier settlements from the savages
situated about the Illinois, and supposing the danger
would be greatly obviated by an enterprise against the
English forts and possessions in that country, which
were well known to inspire the savages with their bloody
purposes against us, sent a detachment of militia, consisting
of one hundred and seventy or eighty men
commanded by Colonel George Rogers Clark, on that
service some time last spring. By despatches which I
have just received from Colonel Clark, it appears that
his success has equalled the most sanguine expectations.
He has not only reduced Fort Chartres and its dependencies,
but has struck such a terror into the Indian
tribes between that settlement and the lakes that no less
than five of them, viz., the Puans, Sacks, Renards, Powtowantanies,
and Miamis, who had received the hatchet
from the English emissaries, have submitted to our arms
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
all their English presents, and bound themselves by
treaties and promises to be peaceful in the future.</p>

<p>The great Blackbird, the Chappowow chief, has also
sent a belt of peace to Colonel Clark, influenced, he
supposes, by the dread of Detroit&#8217;s being reduced by
American arms. This latter place, according to Colonel
Clark&#8217;s representation, is at present defended by so inconsiderable
a garrison and so scantily furnished with
provisions, for which they must be still more distressed
by the loss of supplies from the Illinois, that it might
be reduced by any number of men above five hundred.
The governor of that place, Mr. Hamilton, was exerting
himself to engage the savages to assist him in retaking
the places that had fallen into our hands; but the favorable
impression made on the Indians in general in that
quarter, the influence of the French on them, and the
re&euml;nforcement of their militia Colonel Clark expected,
flattered him that there was little danger to be apprehended.&hellip;
If the party under Colonel Clark can
co&ouml;perate in any respect with the measures Congress are
pursuing or have in view, I shall with pleasure give
him the necessary orders. In order to improve and
secure the advantages gained by Colonel Clark, I propose
to support him with a re&euml;nforcement of militia.
But this will depend on the pleasure of the Assembly, to
whose consideration the measure is submitted.</p>

<p>The French inhabitants have manifested great zeal
and attachment to our cause, and insist on garrisons remaining
with them under Colonel Clark. This I am
induced to agree to, because the safety of our own frontiers
as well as that of these people demands a compliance
with this request. Were it possible to secure the
St. Lawrence and prevent the English attempts up that
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
river by seizing some post on it, peace with the Indians
would seem to me to be secured.</p>

<p>With great regard I have the honor to be, Gent<sup>n</sup>,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="right3">Your most obedient servant,<br /></span>
<span class="right1"><span class="smcap">P. Henry.</span><a name="FNanchor294" id="FNanchor294"></a><a href="#Footnote-294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>During the autumn session of the General Assembly,
that body showed its continued confidence
in the governor by passing several acts conferring
on him extraordinary powers, in addition to those
already bestowed.<a name="FNanchor295" id="FNanchor295"></a><a href="#Footnote-295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>A letter which the governor wrote at this period
to the president of Congress, respecting military
aid from Virginia to States further south, may give
us some idea, not only of his own practical discernment
in the matters involved, but of the confusion
which, in those days, often attended military plans
issuing from a many-headed executive:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right1"><span class="smcap">Williamsburg</span>, November 28, 1778.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Your favor of the 16th instant is come to
hand, together with the acts of Congress of the 26th of
August for establishing provision for soldiers and sailors
maimed or disabled in the public service,&mdash;of the 26th
of September for organizing the treasury, a proclamation
for a general thanksgiving, and three copies of the
alliance between his most Christian Majesty and these
United States.</p>

<p>I lost no time in laying your letter before the privy
council, and in deliberating with them on the subject of
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
sending 1000 militia to Charlestown, South Carolina. I
beg to assure Congress of the great zeal of every member
of the executive here to give full efficacy to their
designs on every occasion. But on the present, I am
very sorry to observe, that obstacles great and I fear
unsurmountable are opposed to the immediate march of
the men. Upon requisition to the deputy quartermaster-general
in this department for tents, kettles, blankets,
and wagons, he informs they cannot be had. The season
when the march must begin will be severe and inclement,
and, without the forementioned necessaries,
impracticable to men indifferently clad and equipped as
they are in the present general scarcity of clothes.</p>

<p>The council, as well as myself, are not a little perplexed
on comparing this requisition to defend South
Carolina and Georgia from the assaults of the enemy,
with that made a few days past for galleys to conquer
East Florida. The galleys have orders to rendezvous at
Charlestown, which I was taught to consider as a place
of acknowledged safety; and I beg leave to observe,
that there seems some degree of inconsistency in marching
militia such a distance in the depth of winter, under
the want of necessaries, to defend a place which the former
measures seemed to declare safe.</p>

<p>The act of Assembly whereby it is made lawful to
order their march, confines the operations to measures
merely defensive to a sister State, and of whose danger
there is certain information received.</p>

<p>However, as Congress have not been pleased to explain
the matters herein alluded to, and altho&#8217; a good
deal of perplexity remains with me on the subject, I
have by advice of the privy council given orders for
1000 men to be instantly got into readiness to march to
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
Charlestown, and they will march as soon as they are
furnished with tents, kettles, and wagons. In the mean
time, if intelligence is received that their march is essential
to the preservation of either of the States of
South Carolina or Georgia the men will encounter every
difficulty, and have orders to proceed in the best way
they can without waiting to be supplied with those
necessaries commonly afforded to troops even on a summer&#8217;s
march.</p>

<p>I have to beg that Congress will please to remember
the state of embarrassment in which I must necessarily
remain with respect to the ordering galleys to Charlestown,
in their way to invade Florida, while the militia
are getting ready to defend the States bordering on it,
and that they will please to favor me with the earliest
intelligence of every circumstance that is to influence the
measures either offensive or defensive.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient and
very humble servant,</p>

<p class="right1"><span class="smcap">P. Henry.</span><a name="FNanchor296" id="FNanchor296"></a><a href="#Footnote-296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>By the early spring of 1779, it became still more
apparent that the purpose of the enemy was to
shift the scene of their activity from the middle
States to the South, and that Virginia, whose soil
had never thus far been bruised by the tread of
a hostile army, must soon experience that dire
calamity. Perhaps no one saw this more clearly
than did Governor Henry. At the same time, he
also saw that Virginia must in part defend herself
by helping to defend her sister States at the South,
across whose territories the advance of the enemy
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
into Virginia was likely to be attempted. His
clear grasp of the military situation, in all the
broad relations of his own State to it, is thus revealed
in a letter to Washington, dated at Williamsburg,
13th of March, 1779:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;My last accounts from the South are unfavorable.
Georgia is said to be in full possession of the enemy,
and South Carolina in great danger. The number of
disaffected there is said to be formidable, and the Creek
Indians inclining against us. One thousand militia are
ordered thither from our southern counties; but a doubt
is started whether they are by law obliged to march. I
have also proposed a scheme to embody volunteers for
this service; but I fear the length of the march, and a
general scarcity of bread, which prevails in some parts
of North Carolina and this State, may impede this service.
About five hundred militia are ordered down the
Tennessee River, to chastise some new settlements of
renegade Cherokees that infest our southwestern frontier,
and prevent our navigation on that river, from
which we began to hope for great advantages. Our
militia have full possession of the Illinois and the posts
on the Wabash; and I am not without hopes that the
same party may overawe the Indians as far as Detroit.
They are independent of General McIntosh, whose numbers,
although upwards of two thousand, I think could
not make any great progress, on account, it is said, of
the route they took, and the lateness of the season.</p>

<p>&#8220;The conquest of Illinois and Wabash was effected
with less than two hundred men, who will soon be re&euml;nforced;
and, by holding posts on the back of the Indians,
it is hoped may intimidate them. Forts Natchez
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
and Morishac are again in the enemy&#8217;s hands; and
from thence they infest and ruin our trade on the Mississippi,
on which river the Spaniards wish to open a
very interesting commerce with us. I have requested
Congress to authorize the conquest of those two posts,
as the possession of them will give a colorable pretence
to retain all West Florida, when a treaty may be
opened.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor297" id="FNanchor297"></a><a href="#Footnote-297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p></div>

<p>Within two months after that letter was written,
the dreaded warships of the enemy were ploughing
the waters of Virginia: it was the sorrow-bringing
expedition of Matthews and Sir George Collier.
The news of their arrival was thus conveyed by
Governor Henry to the president of Congress:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right1"><span class="smcap">Williamsburg</span>, 11 May, 1779.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;On Saturday last, in the evening, a British
fleet amounting to about thirty sail &hellip; came into the
Bay of Chesapeake, and the next day proceeded to
Hampton Road, where they anchored and remained
quiet until yesterday about noon, when several of the
ships got under way, and proceeded towards Portsmouth,
which place I have no doubt they intend to attack
by water or by land or by both, as they have many
flat-bottomed boats with them for the purpose of landing
their troops. As I too well know the weakness of that
garrison, I am in great pain for the consequences, there
being great quantities of merchandise, the property of
French merchants and others in this State, at that place,
as well as considerable quantities of military stores,
which, tho&#8217; measures some time since were taken to
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
remove, may nevertheless fall into the enemy&#8217;s hands.
Whether they may hereafter intend to fortify and
maintain this post is at present unknown to me, but
the consequences which will result to this State and
to the United States finally if such a measure should
be adopted must be obvious. Whether it may be in the
power of Congress to adopt any measures which can in
any manner counteract the design of the enemy is submitted
to their wisdom. At present, I cannot avoid
intimating that I have the greatest reason to think that
many vessels from France with public and private merchandise
may unfortunately arrive while the enemy remain
in perfect possession of the Bay of Chesapeake,
and fall victims unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Every precaution will be taken to order lookout boats
on the seacoasts to furnish proper intelligence; but the
success attending this necessary measure will be precarious
in the present situation of things.<a name="FNanchor298" id="FNanchor298"></a><a href="#Footnote-298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p></div>

<p>On the next day the governor had still heavier
tidings for the same correspondent:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right1"><span class="smcap">Williamsburg</span>, May 12, 1779.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I addressed you yesterday upon a subject of
the greatest consequence. The last night brought me
the fatal account of Portsmouth being in possession of
the enemy. Their force was too great to be resisted,
and therefore the fort was evacuated after destroying
one capital ship belonging to the State and one or two
private ones loaded with tobacco. Goods and merchandise,
however, of very great value fall into the enemy&#8217;s
hands. If Congress could by solicitations procure a
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
fleet superior to the enemy&#8217;s force to enter Chesapeake
at this critical period, the prospect of gain and advantage
would be great indeed. I have the honor to be,
with the greatest regard, Sir,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="right3">Your most humble and obedient servant,</span> <br />

<span class="smcap">P. Henry.</span><a name="FNanchor299" id="FNanchor299"></a><a href="#Footnote-299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>
</div>

<p>To meet this dreadful invasion, the governor attempted
to arouse and direct vigorous measures, in
part by a proclamation, on the 14th of May, announcing
to the people of Virginia the facts of the
case, &#8220;and requiring the county lieutenants and
other military officers in the Commonwealth, and
especially those on the navigable waters, to hold
their respective militias in readiness to oppose the
attempts of the enemy wherever they might be
made.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor300" id="FNanchor300"></a><a href="#Footnote-300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>On the 21st of the month, in a letter to the
president of Congress, he reported the havoc then
wrought by the enemy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right1"><span class="smcap">Williamsburg</span>, May 21, 1779.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Being in the greatest haste to dispatch your
express, I have not time to give you any very particular
information concerning the present invasion. Let it
suffice therefore to inform Congress that the number of
the enemy&#8217;s ships are nearly the same as was mentioned
in my former letter; with regard to the number of
the troops which landed and took Portsmouth, and afterwards
proceeded and burnt, plundered, and destroyed
Suffolk, committing various barbarities, etc., we are
still ignorant, as the accounts from the deserters differ
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
widely; perhaps, however, it may not exceed 2000 or
2500 men.</p>

<p>I trust that a sufficient number of troops are embodied
and stationed in certain proportions at this place,
York, Hampton, and on the south side of James River.&hellip; When
any further particulars come to my knowledge
they shall be communicated to Congress without
delay.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, Sir, your humble servant,</p>

<p class="right1 smcap">P. Henry.</p>

<p>P. S. I am pretty certain that the land forces are
commanded by Gen&#8217;l Matthews and the fleet by Sir
George Collier.<a name="FNanchor301" id="FNanchor301"></a><a href="#Footnote-301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the very midst of this ugly storm, it was required
that the ship of state should undergo a
change of commanders. The third year for which
Governor Henry had been elected was nearly at
an end. There were some members of the Assembly
who thought him eligible as governor for still
another year, on the ground that his first election
was by the convention, and that the year of office
which that body gave to him &#8220;was merely provisory,&#8221;
and formed no proper part of his constitutional
term.<a name="FNanchor302" id="FNanchor302"></a><a href="#Footnote-302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Governor Henry himself, however,
could not fail to perceive the unfitness of any struggle
upon such a question at such a time, as well as
the futility which would attach to that high office,
if held, amid such perils, under a clouded title.
Accordingly, on the 28th of May, he cut short all
discussion by sending to the speaker of the House
of Delegates the following letter:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
<p class="right1">May 28, 1779.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;The term for which I had the honor to be
elected governor by the late Assembly being just about
to expire, and the Constitution, as I think, making me
ineligible to that office, I take the liberty to communicate
to the Assembly through you, Sir, my intention to
retire in four or five days.</p>

<p>I have thought it necessary to give this notification of
my design, in order that the Assembly may have the
earliest opportunity of deliberating upon the choice of a
successor to me in office.</p>

<p>With great regard, I have the honor to be, Sir, your
most obedient servant,</p>

<p class="right1">
<span class="smcap">P. Henry.</span><a name="FNanchor303" id="FNanchor303"></a><a href="#Footnote-303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>On the first of June, Thomas Jefferson was
elected to succeed him in office, but by a majority
of only six votes out of one hundred and twenty-eight.<a name="FNanchor304" id="FNanchor304"></a><a href="#Footnote-304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
On the following day Patrick Henry, having
received certain resolutions from the General
Assembly<a name="FNanchor305" id="FNanchor305"></a><a href="#Footnote-305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> commending him for his conduct while
governor, graciously closed this chapter of his official
life by the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;The House of Delegates have done
me very great honor in the vote expressive of their approbation
of my public conduct. I beg the favor of
you, gentlemen, to convey to that honorable house my
most cordial acknowledgments, and to assure them that
I shall ever retain a grateful remembrance of the high
honor they have now conferred on me.<a name="FNanchor306" id="FNanchor306"></a><a href="#Footnote-306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
In the midst of these frank voices of public appreciation
over the fidelity and efficiency of his
service as governor, there were doubtless the usual
murmurs of partisan criticism or of personal ill-will.
For example, a few days after Jefferson had
taken his seat in the stately chair which Patrick
Henry had just vacated, St. George Tucker, in a
letter to Theophilus Bland, gave expression to this
sneer: &#8220;<i>Sub rosa</i>, I wish his excellency&#8217;s activity
may be equal to the abilities he possesses in so
eminent a degree.&hellip; But if he should tread in
the steps of his predecessor, there is not much to
be expected from the brightest talents.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor307" id="FNanchor307"></a><a href="#Footnote-307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> Over
against a taunt like this, one can scarcely help
placing the fact that the general of the armies
who, for three stern years, had been accustomed to
lean heavily for help on this governor of Virginia,
and who never paid idle compliments, nevertheless
paid many a tribute to the intelligence, zeal, and
vigorous activity of Governor Henry&#8217;s administration.
Thus, on the 27th of December, 1777, Washington
writes to him: &#8220;In several of my late letters
I addressed you on the distress of the troops
for want of clothing. Your ready exertions to relieve
them have given me the highest satisfaction.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor308" id="FNanchor308"></a><a href="#Footnote-308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
On the 19th of February, 1778, Washington
again writes to him: &#8220;I address myself to
you, convinced that our alarming distresses will
engage your most serious consideration, and that
the full force of that zeal and vigor you have manifested
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
upon every other occasion, will now operate
for our relief, in a matter that so nearly affects
the very existence of our contest.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor309" id="FNanchor309"></a><a href="#Footnote-309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> On the 19th
of April, 1778, Washington once more writes to
him: &#8220;I hold myself infinitely obliged to the legislature
for the ready attention which they have paid
to my representation of the wants of the army, and
to you for the strenuous manner in which you have
recommended to the people an observance of my
request.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor310" id="FNanchor310"></a><a href="#Footnote-310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> Finally, if any men had even better
opportunities than Washington for estimating correctly
Governor Henry&#8217;s efficiency in his great
office, surely those men were his intimate associates,
the members of the Virginia legislature. It
is quite possible that their first election of him as
governor may have been in ignorance of his real
qualities as an executive officer; but this cannot
be said of their second and of their third elections
of him, each one of which was made, as we have
seen, without one audible lisp of opposition. Is it
to be believed that, if he had really shown that lack
of executive efficiency which St. George Tucker&#8217;s
sneer implies, such a body of men, in such a crisis
of public danger, would have twice and thrice
elected him to the highest executive office in the
State, and that, too, without one dissenting vote?
To say so, indeed, is to fix a far more damning
censure upon them than upon him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI <br />
<span class="hsub">AT HOME AND IN THE HOUSE OF DELEGATES</span></h2>


<p>The high official rank which Governor Henry
had borne during the first three years of American
independence was so impressive to the imaginations
of the French allies who were then in the country,
that some of them addressed their letters to him
as &#8220;Son Altesse Royale, Monsieur Patrick Henri,
Gouverneur de l&#8217;Etat de Virginie.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor311" id="FNanchor311"></a><a href="#Footnote-311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> From this
titular royalty he descended, as we have seen,
about the 1st of June, 1779; and for the subsequent
five and a half years, until his recall to the
governorship, he is to be viewed by us as a very
retired country gentleman in delicate health, with
episodes of labor and of leadership in the Virginia
House of Delegates.</p>

<p>A little more than a fortnight after his descent
from the governor&#8217;s chair, he was elected by the
General Assembly as a delegate in Congress.<a name="FNanchor312" id="FNanchor312"></a><a href="#Footnote-312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> It
is not known whether he at any time thought it
possible for him to accept this appointment; but,
on the 28th of the following October, the body
that had elected him received from him a letter
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
declining the service.<a name="FNanchor313" id="FNanchor313"></a><a href="#Footnote-313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> Moreover, in spite of all
invitations and entreaties, Patrick Henry never
afterwards served in any public capacity outside
the State of Virginia.</p>

<p>During his three years in the governorship, he
had lived in the palace at Williamsburg. In the
course of that time, also, he had sold his estate of
Scotchtown, in Hanover County, and had purchased
a large tract of land in the new county
of Henry,&mdash;a county situated about two hundred
miles southwest from Richmond, along the North
Carolina boundary, and named, of course, in honor
of himself. To his new estate there, called Leatherwood,
consisting of about ten thousand acres,
he removed early in the summer of 1779. This
continued to be his home until he resumed the
office of governor in November, 1784.<a name="FNanchor314" id="FNanchor314"></a><a href="#Footnote-314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>After the storm and stress of so many years of
public life, and of public life in an epoch of revolution,
the invalid body, the care-burdened spirit,
of Patrick Henry must have found great refreshment
in this removal to a distant, wild, and mountainous
solitude. In undisturbed seclusion, he
there remained during the summer and autumn
of 1779, and even the succeeding winter and
spring,&mdash;scarcely able to hear the far-off noises of
the great struggle in which he had hitherto borne
so rugged a part, and of which the victorious issue
was then to be seen by him, though dimly, through
many a murky rack of selfishness, cowardice, and
crime.<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>His successor in the office of governor was
Thomas Jefferson, the jovial friend of his own
jovial youth, bound to him still by that hearty
friendship which was founded on congeniality of
political sentiment, but was afterward to die away,
at least on Jefferson&#8217;s side, into alienation and
hate. To this dear friend Patrick Henry wrote
late in that winter, from his hermitage among the
eastward fastnesses of the Blue Ridge, a remarkable
letter, which has never before been in print,
and which is full of interest for us on account of
its impulsive and self-revealing words. Its tone of
despondency, almost of misanthropy,&mdash;so unnatural
to Patrick Henry,&mdash;is perhaps a token of
that sickness of body which had made the soul sick
too, and had then driven the writer into the wilderness,
and still kept him there:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.</p>

<p class="right1">
<span class="smcap">Leatherwood</span>, 15th Feby., 1780.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I return you many thanks for your
favor by Mr. Sanders. The kind notice you were
pleased to take of me was particularly obliging, as I
have scarcely heard a word of public matters since
I moved up in the retirement where I live.</p>

<p>I have had many anxieties for our commonwealth,
principally occasioned by the depreciation of our money.
To judge by this, which somebody has called the pulse
of the state, I have feared that our body politic was
dangerously sick. God grant it may not be unto death.
But I cannot forbear thinking, the present increase of
prices is in great part owing to a kind of habit, which
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
is now of four or five years&#8217; growth, which is fostered
by a mistaken avarice, and like other habits hard to
part with. For there is really very little money hereabouts.</p>

<p>What you say of the practice of our distinguished
Tories perfectly agrees with my own observation, and
the attempts to raise prejudices against the French, I
know, were begun when I lived below. What gave me
the utmost pain was to see some men, indeed very many,
who were thought good Whigs, keep company with the
miscreants,&mdash;wretches who, I am satisfied, were laboring
our destruction. This countenance shown them is
of fatal tendency. They should be shunned and execrated,
and this is the only way to supply the place of
legal conviction and punishment. But this is an effort
of virtue, small as it seems, of which our countrymen
are not capable.</p>

<p>Indeed, I will own to you, my dear Sir, that observing
this impunity and even respect, which some wicked
individuals have met with while their guilt was clear
as the sun, has sickened me, and made me sometimes
wish to be in retirement for the rest of my life. I will,
however, be down, on the next Assembly, if I am
chosen. My health, I am satisfied, will never again
permit a close application to sedentary business, and
I even doubt whether I can remain below long enough
to serve in the Assembly. I will, however, make the
trial.</p>

<p>But tell me, do you remember any instance where
tyranny was destroyed and freedom established on its
ruins, among a people possessing so small a share of
virtue and public spirit? I recollect none, and this,
more than the British arms, makes me fearful of final
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
success without a reform. But when or how this is to
be effected, I have not the means of judging. I most
sincerely wish you health and prosperity. If you can
spare time to drop me a line now and then, it will be
highly obliging to, dear Sir, your affectionate friend
and obedient servant,</p>

<p class="right1">
<span class="smcap">P. Henry.</span><a name="FNanchor315" id="FNanchor315"></a><a href="#Footnote-315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>
</p></div>

<p>The next General Assembly, which he thus
promised to attend in case he should be chosen,
met at Richmond on the 1st of May, 1780. It
hardly needs to be mentioned that the people of
Henry County were proud to choose him as one of
their members in that body; but he seems not to
have taken his seat there until about the 19th of
May.<a name="FNanchor316" id="FNanchor316"></a><a href="#Footnote-316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> From the moment of his arrival in the
House of Delegates, every kind of responsibility
and honor was laid upon him. This was his first
appearance in such an assembly since the proclamation
of independence; and the prestige attaching
to his name, as well as his own undimmed
genius for leadership, made him not only the most
conspicuous person in the house, but the nearly
absolute director of its business in every detail
of opinion and of procedure on which he should
choose to express himself,&mdash;his only rival, in any
particular, being Richard Henry Lee. It helps
one now to understand the real reputation he had
among his contemporaries for practical ability, and
for a habit of shrinking from none of the commonplace
drudgeries of legislative work, that during
the first few days after his accession to the House
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
he was placed on the committee of ways and
means; on a committee &#8220;to inquire into the present
state of the account of the commonwealth
against the United States, and the most speedy
and effectual method of finally settling the same;&#8221;
on a committee to prepare a bill for the repeal of
a part of the act &#8220;for sequestering British property,
enabling those indebted to British subjects
to pay off such debts, and directing the proceedings
in suits where such subjects are parties;&#8221; on three
several committees respecting the powers and duties
of high sheriffs and of grand juries; and,
finally, on a committee to notify Jefferson of his
re&euml;lection as governor, and to report his answer to
the House. On the 7th of June, however, after a
service of little more than two weeks, his own sad
apprehensions respecting his health seem to have
been realized, and he was obliged to ask leave to
withdraw from the House for the remainder of the
session.<a name="FNanchor317" id="FNanchor317"></a><a href="#Footnote-317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>At the autumn session of the legislature he was
once more in his place. On the 6th of November,
the day on which the House was organized, he was
made chairman of the committee on privileges and
elections, and also of a committee &#8220;for the better
defence of the southern frontier,&#8221; and was likewise
placed on the committee on propositions and grievances,
as well as on the committee on courts of
justice. On the following day he was made a
member of a committee for the defence of the eastern
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
frontier. On the 10th of November he was
placed on a committee to bring in a bill relating
to the enlistment of Virginia troops, and to the redemption
of the state bills of credit then in circulation,
and the emission of new bills. On the 22d
of November he was made a member of a committee
to which was again referred the account between
the State and the United States. On the
9th of December he was made a member of a committee
to draw up bills for the organization and
maintenance of a navy for the State, and the protection
of navigation and commerce upon its waters.
On the 14th of December he was made
chairman of a committee to draw up a bill for the
better regulation and discipline of the militia, and
of still another committee to prepare a bill &#8220;for
supplying the army with clothes and provisions.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor318" id="FNanchor318"></a><a href="#Footnote-318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
On the 28th of December, the House having knowledge
of the arrival in town of poor General Gates,
then drooping under the burden of those Southern
willows which he had so plentifully gathered at
Camden, Patrick Henry introduced the following
magnanimous resolution:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;That a committee of four be appointed to wait on
Major General Gates, and to assure him of the high regard
and esteem of this House; that the remembrance
of his former glorious services cannot be obliterated by
any reverse of fortune; but that this House, ever mindful
of his great merit, will omit no opportunity of testifying
to the world the gratitude which, as a member of
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
the American Union, this country owes to him in his
military character.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor319" id="FNanchor319"></a><a href="#Footnote-319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p></div>

<p>On the 2d of January, 1781, the last day of the
session, the House adopted, on Patrick Henry&#8217;s
motion, a resolution authorizing the governor to
convene the next meeting of the legislature at
some other place than Richmond, in case its assembling
in that city should &#8220;be rendered inconvenient
by the operations of an invading enemy,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor320" id="FNanchor320"></a><a href="#Footnote-320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
a resolution reflecting their sense of the peril then
hanging over the State.</p>

<p>Before the legislature could again meet, events
proved that it was no imaginary danger against
which Patrick Henry&#8217;s resolution had been intended
to provide. On the 2d of January, 1781,
the very day on which the legislature had adjourned,
a hostile fleet conveyed into the James
River a force of about eight hundred men under
command of Benedict Arnold, whose eagerness to
ravage Virginia was still further facilitated by the
arrival, on the 26th of March, of two thousand
men under General Phillips. Moreover, Lord
Cornwallis, having beaten General Greene at
Guilford, in North Carolina, on the 15th of
March, seemed to be gathering force for a speedy
advance into Virginia. That the roar of his guns
would soon be heard in the outskirts of their capital,
was what all Virginians then felt to be inevitable.<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>Under such circumstances, it is not strange that
a session of the legislature, which is said to have
been held on the 1st of March,<a name="FNanchor321" id="FNanchor321"></a><a href="#Footnote-321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> should have been
a very brief one, or that when the 7th of May
arrived&mdash;the day for its reassembling at Richmond&mdash;no
quorum should have been present; or
that, on the 10th of May, the few members who
had arrived in Richmond should have voted, in
deference to &#8220;the approach of an hostile army,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor322" id="FNanchor322"></a><a href="#Footnote-322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>
to adjourn to Charlottesville,&mdash;a place of far
greater security, ninety-seven miles to the northwest,
among the mountains of Albemarle. By
the 20th of May, Cornwallis reached Petersburg,
twenty-three miles south of Richmond; and shortly
afterward, pushing across the James and the Chickahominy,
he encamped on the North Anna, in the
county of Hanover. Thus, at last, the single
county of Louisa then separated him from that
county in which was the home of the governor of
the State, and where was then convened its legislature,&mdash;Patrick
Henry himself being present and
in obvious direction of all its business. The opportunity
to bag such game, Lord Cornwallis was
not the man to let slip. Accordingly, on Sunday,
the 3d of June, he dispatched a swift expedition
under Tarleton, to surprise and capture the members
of the legislature, &#8220;to seize on the person of
the governor,&#8221; and &#8220;to spread on his route devastation
and terror.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor323" id="FNanchor323"></a><a href="#Footnote-323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> In this entire scheme, doubtless,<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
Tarleton would have succeeded, had it not
been that as he and his troopers, on that fair Sabbath
day, were hurrying past the Cuckoo tavern in
Louisa, one Captain John Jouette, watching from
behind the windows, espied them, divined their
object, and mounting a fleet horse, and taking a
shorter route, got into Charlottesville a few hours
in advance of them, just in time to give the alarm,
and to set the imperiled legislators a-flying to the
mountains for safety.</p>

<p>Then, by all accounts, was witnessed a display
of the locomotive energies of grave and potent
senators, such as this world has not often exhibited.
Of this tragically comical incident, of course,
the journal of the House of Delegates makes only
the most placid and forbearing mention. For
Monday, June 4, its chief entry is as follows:
&#8220;There being reason to apprehend an immediate
incursion of the enemy&#8217;s cavalry to this place,
which renders it indispensable that the General
Assembly should forthwith adjourn to a place of
greater security; resolved, that this House be adjourned
until Thursday next, then to meet at the
town of Staunton, in the county of Augusta,&#8221;&mdash;a
town thirty-nine miles farther west, beyond a
chain of mountains, and only to be reached by
them or their pursuers through difficult passes in
the Blue Ridge. The next entry in the journal is
dated at Staunton, on the 7th of June, and, very
properly, is merely a prosaic and business-like

record of the reassembling of the House according
to the adjournment aforesaid.<a name="FNanchor324" id="FNanchor324"></a><a href="#Footnote-324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>But as to some of the things that happened in
that interval of panic and of scrambling flight,
popular tradition has not been equally forbearing;
and while the anecdotes upon that subject, which
have descended to our time, are very likely decorated
by many tassels of exaggeration and of
myth, they yet have, doubtless, some slight framework
of truth, and do really portray for us the
actual beliefs of many people in Virginia respecting
a number of their celebrated men, and especially
respecting some of the less celebrated traits
of those men. For example, it is related that on
the sudden adjournment of the House, caused by
this dusty and breathless apparition of the speedful
Jouette, and his laconic intimation that Tarleton
was coming, the members, though somewhat
accustomed to ceremony, stood not upon the order
of their going, but went at once,&mdash;taking first to
their horses, and then to the woods; and that,
breaking up into small parties of fugitives, they
thus made their several ways, as best they could,
through the passes of the mountains leading to the
much-desired seclusion of Staunton. One of these
parties consisted of Benjamin Harrison, Colonel
William Christian, John Tyler, and Patrick Henry.
Late in the day, tired and hungry, they stopped
their horses at the door of a small hut, in a gorge
of the hills, and asked for food. An old woman,<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
who came to the door, and who was alone in the
house, demanded of them who they were, and
where they were from. Patrick Henry, who acted
as spokesman of the party, answered: &#8220;We are
members of the legislature, and have just been
compelled to leave Charlottesville on account of
the approach of the enemy.&#8221; &#8220;Ride on, then, ye
cowardly knaves,&#8221; replied she, in great wrath;
&#8220;here have my husband and sons just gone to
Charlottesville to fight for ye, and you running
away with all your might. Clear out&mdash;ye shall
have nothing here.&#8221; &#8220;But,&#8221; rejoined Mr. Henry,
in an expostulating tone, &#8220;we were obliged to fly.
It would not do for the legislature to be broken
up by the enemy. Here is Mr. Speaker Harrison;
you don&#8217;t think he would have fled had it not been
necessary?&#8221; &#8220;I always thought a great deal of
Mr. Harrison till now,&#8221; answered the old woman;
&#8220;but he&#8217;d no business to run from the enemy,&#8221;
and she was about to shut the door in their faces.
&#8220;Wait a moment, my good woman,&#8221; urged Mr.
Henry; &#8220;you would hardly believe that Mr. Tyler
or Colonel Christian would take to flight if there
were not good cause for so doing?&#8221; &#8220;No, indeed,
that I wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;But,&#8221; exclaimed
he, &#8220;Mr. Tyler and Colonel Christian are here.&#8221;
&#8220;They here? Well, I never would have thought
it;&#8221; and she stood for a moment in doubt, but at
once added, &#8220;No matter. We love these gentlemen,
and I didn&#8217;t suppose they would ever run away
from the British; but since they have, they shall
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
have nothing to eat in my house. You may ride
along.&#8221; In this desperate situation Mr. Tyler then
stepped forward and said, &#8220;What would you say,
my good woman, if I were to tell you that Patrick
Henry fled with the rest of us?&#8221; &#8220;Patrick Henry!
I should tell you there wasn&#8217;t a word of truth in
it,&#8221; she answered angrily; &#8220;Patrick Henry would
never do such a cowardly thing.&#8221; &#8220;But this is
Patrick Henry,&#8221; said Mr. Tyler, pointing to him.
The old woman was amazed; but after some reflection,
and with a convulsive twitch or two at her
apron string, she said, &#8220;Well, then, if that&#8217;s Patrick
Henry, it must be all right. Come in, and
ye shall have the best I have in the house.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor325" id="FNanchor325"></a><a href="#Footnote-325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>The pitiless tongue of tradition does not stop
here, but proceeds to narrate other alleged experiences
of this our noble, though somewhat disconcerted,
Patrick. Arrived at last in Staunton, and
walking through its reassuring streets, he is said
to have met one Colonel William Lewis, to whom
the face of the orator was then unknown; and to
have told to this stranger the story of the flight
of the legislature from Albemarle. &#8220;If Patrick
Henry had been in Albemarle,&#8221; was the stranger&#8217;s
comment, &#8220;the British dragoons never would have
passed over the Rivanna River.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor326" id="FNanchor326"></a><a href="#Footnote-326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>The tongue of tradition, at last grown quite reckless,
perhaps, of its own credit, still further relates
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
that even at Staunton these illustrious fugitives
did not feel entirely sure that they were beyond
the reach of Tarleton&#8217;s men. A few nights after
their arrival there, as the story runs, upon some
sudden alarm, several of them sprang from their
beds, and, imperfectly clapping on their clothes,
fled out of the town, and took refuge at the plantation
of one Colonel George Moffett, near which,
they had been told, was a cave in which they might
the more effectually conceal themselves. Mrs.
Moffett, though not knowing the names of these
flitting Solons, yet received them with true Virginian
hospitality: but the next morning, at breakfast,
she made the unlucky remark that there was
one member of the legislature who certainly would
not have run from the enemy. &#8220;Who is he?&#8221;
was then asked. Her reply was, &#8220;Patrick Henry.&#8221;
At that moment a gentleman of the party, himself
possessed of but one boot, was observed to blush
considerably. Furthermore, as soon as possible
after breakfast, these imperiled legislators departed
in search of the cave; shortly after which a negro
from Staunton rode up, carrying in his hand a
solitary boot, and inquiring earnestly for Patrick
Henry. In that way, as the modern reporter of
this very debatable tradition unkindly adds, the
admiring Mrs. Moffett ascertained who it was that
the boot fitted; and he further suggests that, whatever
Mrs. Moffett&#8217;s emotions were at that time,
those of Patrick must have been, &#8220;Give me liberty,
but not death.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor327" id="FNanchor327"></a><a href="#Footnote-327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p><span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
Passing by these whimsical tales, we have now
to add that the legislature, having on the 7th of
June entered upon its work at Staunton, steadily
continued it there until the 23d of the month, when
it adjourned in orderly fashion, to meet again in
the following October. Governor Jefferson, whose
second year of office had expired two days before
the flight of himself and the legislature from Charlottesville,
did not accompany that body to Staunton,
but pursued his own way to Poplar Forest
and to Bedford, where, &#8220;remote from the legislature,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor328" id="FNanchor328"></a><a href="#Footnote-328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>
he remained during the remainder of its
session. On the 12th of June, Thomas Nelson was
elected as his successor in office.<a name="FNanchor329" id="FNanchor329"></a><a href="#Footnote-329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>


<p>It was during this period of confusion and terror
that, as Jefferson alleges, the legislature once
more had before it the project of a dictator, in the
criminal sense of that word; and, upon Jefferson&#8217;s
private authority, both Wirt and Girardin long
afterward named Patrick Henry as the man who
was intended for this profligate honor.<a name="FNanchor330" id="FNanchor330"></a><a href="#Footnote-330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> We need
not here repeat what was said, in our narrative of
the closing weeks of 1776, concerning this terrible
posthumous imputation upon the public and private
character of Patrick Henry. Nearly everything
which then appeared to the discredit of this charge
in connection with the earlier date, is equally applicable
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
to it in connection with the later date also.
Moreover, as regards this later date, there has recently
been discovered a piece of contemporaneous
testimony which shows that, whatever may have
been the scheme for a dictatorship in Virginia in
1781, it was a great military chieftain who was
wanted for the position; and, apparently, that Patrick
Henry was not then even mentioned in the
affair. On the 9th of June, 1781, Captain H.
Young, though not a member of the House of
Delegates, writes from Staunton to Colonel William
Davies as follows: &#8220;Two days ago, Mr. Nicholas
gave notice that he should this day move to
have a dictator appointed. General Washington
and General Greene are talked of. I dare say
your knowledge of these worthy gentlemen will be
sufficient to convince you that neither of them will,
or ought to, accept of such an appointment.&hellip;
We have but a thin House of Delegates; but they
are zealous, I think, in the cause of virtue.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor331" id="FNanchor331"></a><a href="#Footnote-331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> Furthermore,
the journal of that House contains no
record of any such motion having been made; and
it is probable that it never was made, and that the
subject never came before the legislature in any
such form as to call for its notice.</p>

<p>Finally, with respect to both the dates mentioned
by Jefferson for the appearance of the scheme,
Edmund Randolph has left explicit testimony to
the effect that such a scheme never had any substantial
existence at all: &#8220;Mr. Jefferson, in his
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Notes on Virginia, speaks with great bitterness
against those members of the Assembly in the years
1776 and 1781, who espoused the erection of a
dictator. Coming from such authority, the invective
infects the character of the legislature, notwithstanding
he has restricted the charge to less
than a majority, and acknowledged the spotlessness
of most of them.&hellip; The subject was never before
them, except as an article of newspaper intelligence,
and even then not in a form which called
for their attention. Against this unfettered monster,
which deserved all the impassioned reprobation
of Mr. Jefferson, their tones, it may be
affirmed, would have been loud and tremendous.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor332" id="FNanchor332"></a><a href="#Footnote-332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>For its autumn session, in 1781, the legislature
did not reach an organization until the 19th of
November,&mdash;just one month after the surrender
of Cornwallis. Eight days after the organization
of the House, Patrick Henry took his seat;<a name="FNanchor333" id="FNanchor333"></a><a href="#Footnote-333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> and
after a service of less than four weeks, he obtained
leave of absence for the remainder of the session.<a name="FNanchor334" id="FNanchor334"></a><a href="#Footnote-334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
During 1782 his attendance upon the House seems
to have been limited to the spring session. At
the organization of the House, on the 12th of May,
1783, he was in his place again, and during that
session, as well as the autumnal one, his attendance
was close and laborious. At both sessions of the
House in 1784 he was present and in full force;<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
but in the very midst of these employments he was
interrupted by his election as governor, on the
17th of November,&mdash;shortly after which, he withdrew
to his country-seat in order to remove his
family thence to the capital.</p>

<p>In the course of all these labors in the legislature,
and amid a multitude of topics merely local and
temporary, Patrick Henry had occasion to deal
publicly, and under the peculiar responsibilities of
leadership, with nearly all the most important and
difficult questions that came before the American
people during the later years of the war and the
earlier years of the peace. The journal of the
House for that period omits all mention of words
spoken in debate; and although it does occasionally
enable us to ascertain on which side of certain
questions Patrick Henry stood, it leaves us in total
ignorance of his reasons for any position which
he chose to take. In trying, therefore, to estimate
the quality of his statesmanship when dealing with
these questions, we lack a part of the evidence
which is essential to any just conclusion; and we
are left peculiarly at the mercy of those sweeping
censures which have been occasionally applied to
his political conduct during that period.<a name="FNanchor335" id="FNanchor335"></a><a href="#Footnote-335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p>On the assurance of peace, in the spring of 1783,
perhaps the earliest and the knottiest problem
which had to be taken up was the one relating to
that vast body of Americans who then bore the
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
contumelious name of Tories,&mdash;those Americans
who, against all loss and ignominy, had steadily
remained loyal to the unity of the British empire,
unflinching in their rejection of the constitutional
heresy of American secession. How should these
execrable beings&mdash;the defeated party in a long
and most rancorous civil war&mdash;be treated by the
party which was at last victorious? Many of them
were already in exile: should they be kept there?
Many were still in this country: should they be
banished from it? As a matter of fact, the exasperation
of public feeling against the Tories was,
at that time, so universal and so fierce that no
statesman could then lift up his voice in their
favor without dashing himself against the angriest
currents of popular opinion and passion, and risking
the loss of the public favor toward himself.
Nevertheless, precisely this is what Patrick Henry
had the courage to do. While the war lasted, no
man spoke against the Tories more sternly than
did he. The war being ended, and its great purpose
secured, no man, excepting perhaps Alexander
Hamilton, was so prompt and so energetic in
urging that all animosities of the war should be
laid aside, and that a policy of magnanimous
forbearance should be pursued respecting these
baffled opponents of American independence. It
was in this spirit that, as soon as possible after the
cessation of hostilities, he introduced a bill for the
repeal of an act &#8220;to prohibit intercourse with, and
the admission of British subjects into&#8221; Virginia,<a name="FNanchor336" id="FNanchor336"></a><a href="#Footnote-336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>&mdash;language
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
well understood to refer to the Tories.
This measure, we are told, not only excited surprise,
but &#8220;was, at first, received with a repugnance
apparently insuperable.&#8221; Even his intimate
friend John Tyler, the speaker of the House,
hotly resisted it in the committee of the whole,
and in the course of his argument, turning to Patrick
Henry, asked &#8220;how he, above all other men,
could think of inviting into his family an enemy
from whose insults and injuries he had suffered so
severely?&#8221;</p>

<p>In reply to this appeal, Patrick Henry declared
that the question before them was not one of personal
feeling; that it was a national question; and
that in discussing it they should be willing to sacrifice
all personal resentments, all private wrongs.
He then proceeded to unfold the proposition that
America had everything out of which to make a
great nation&mdash;except people.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Your great want, sir, is the want of men; and these
you must have, and will have speedily, if you are wise.
Do you ask how you are to get them? Open your
doors, sir, and they will come in. The population of
the Old World is full to overflowing; that population
is ground, too, by the oppressions of the governments
under which they live. Sir, they are already standing
on tiptoe upon their native shores, and looking to your
coasts with a wishful and longing eye.&hellip; But gentlemen
object to any accession from Great Britain, and
particularly to the return of the British refugees. Sir,
I feel no objection to the return of those deluded
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
people. They have, to be sure, mistaken their own
interests most wofully, and most wofully have they
suffered the punishment due to their offences. But the
relations which we bear to them and to their native
country are now changed. Their king hath acknowledged
our independence. The quarrel is over. Peace
hath returned, and found us a free people. Let us have
the magnanimity, sir, to lay aside our antipathies and
prejudices, and consider the subject in a political light.
Those are an enterprising, moneyed people. They will
be serviceable in taking off the surplus produce of our
lands, and supplying us with necessaries during the
infant state of our manufactures. Even if they be
inimical to us in point of feeling and principle, I can
see no objection, in a political view, in making them
tributary to our advantage. And, as I have no prejudices
to prevent my making this use of them, so, sir,
I have no fear of any mischief that they can do us.
Afraid of them? What, sir [said he, rising to one of
his loftiest attitudes, and assuming a look of the most
indignant and sovereign contempt], shall we, who have
laid the proud British lion at our feet, now be afraid of
his whelps?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor337" id="FNanchor337"></a><a href="#Footnote-337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p></div>

<p>In the same spirit he dealt with the restraints
on British commerce imposed during the war,&mdash;a
question similar to the one just mentioned, at least
in this particular, that it was enveloped in the
angry prejudices born of the conflict just ended.
The journal for the 13th of May, 1783, has this
entry: &#8220;Mr. Henry presented, according to order,
a bill &#8216;to repeal the several Acts of Assembly for
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
seizure and condemnation of British goods found
on land;&#8217; and the same was received and read the
first time, and ordered to be read a second time.&#8221;
In advocating this measure, he seems to have lifted
the discussion clear above all petty considerations
to the plane of high and permanent principle, and,
according to one of his chief antagonists in that
debate, to have met all objections by arguments
that were &#8220;beyond all expression eloquent and
sublime.&#8221; After describing the embarrassments
and distresses of the situation and their causes, he
took the ground that perfect freedom was as necessary
to the health and vigor of commerce as it was
to the health and vigor of citizenship. &#8220;Why
should we fetter commerce? If a man is in chains,
he droops and bows to the earth, for his spirits are
broken; but let him twist the fetters from his legs,
and he will stand erect. Fetter not commerce, sir.
Let her be as free as air; she will range the whole
creation, and return on the wings of the four winds
of heaven, to bless the land with plenty.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor338" id="FNanchor338"></a><a href="#Footnote-338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p>Besides these and other problems in the foreign
relations of the country, there remained, of course,
at the end of the war, several vast domestic
problems for American statesmanship to grapple
with,&mdash;one of these being the relations of the
white race to their perpetual neighbors, the Indians.
In the autumn session of 1784, in a series
of efforts said to have been marked by &#8220;irresistible
earnestness and eloquence,&#8221; he secured the
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
favorable attention of the House to this ancient
problem, and even to his own daring and statesmanlike
solution of it. The whole subject, as
he thought, had been commonly treated by the
superior race in a spirit not only mean and hard,
but superficial also; the result being nearly two
centuries of mutual suspicion, hatred, and slaughter.
At last the time had come for the superior race
to put an end to this traditional disaster and disgrace.
Instead of tampering with the difficulty
by remedies applied merely to the surface, he was
for striking at the root of it, namely, at the deep
divergence in sympathy and in interest between
the two races. There was but one way in which
to do this: it was for the white race to treat the
Indians, consistently, as human beings, and as fast
as possible to identify their interests with our own
along the entire range of personal concerns,&mdash;in
property, government, society, and, especially, in
domestic life. In short, he proposed to encourage,
by a system of pecuniary bounties, the practice of
marriage between members of the two races, believing
that such ties, once formed, would be an
inviolable pledge of mutual friendship, fidelity,
and forbearance, and would gradually lead to the
transformation of the Indians into a civilized and
Christian people. His bill for this purpose, elaborately
drawn up, was carried through its second
reading and &#8220;engrossed for its final passage,&#8221;
when, by his sudden removal from the floor of the
House to the governor&#8217;s chair, the measure was
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
deprived of its all-conquering champion, and, on
the third reading, it fell a sacrifice to the Caucasian
rage and scorn of the members.</p>

<p>It is proper to note, also, that during this period
of service in the legislature Patrick Henry marched
straight against public opinion, and jeoparded his
popularity, on two or three other subjects. For
example, the mass of the people of Virginia were
then so angrily opposed to the old connection between
church and state that they occasionally saw
danger even in projects which in no way involved
such a connection. This was the case with Patrick
Henry&#8217;s necessary and most innocent measure &#8220;for
the incorporation of all societies of the Christian
religion which may apply for the same;&#8221; likewise,
his bill for the incorporation of the clergy of the
Episcopal Church; and, finally, his more questionable
and more offensive resolution for requiring all
citizens of the State to contribute to the expense of
supporting some form of religious worship according
to their own preference.</p>

<p>Whether, in these several measures, Patrick
Henry was right or wrong, one thing, at least, is
obvious: no politician who could thus beard in his
very den the lion of public opinion can be accurately
described as a demagogue.</p>

<p>With respect to those amazing gifts of speech
by which, in the House of Delegates, he thus repeatedly
swept all opposition out of his way, and
made people think as he wished them to do, often
in the very teeth of their own immediate interests
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
or prepossessions, an amusing instance was mentioned,
many years afterward, by President James
Madison. During the war Virginia had paid her
soldiers in certificates for the amounts due them,
to be redeemed in cash at some future time. In
many cases, the poverty of the soldiers had induced
them to sell these certificates, for trifling sums in
ready money, to certain speculators, who were thus
making a traffic out of the public distress. For
the purpose of checking this cruel and harmful
business, Madison brought forward a suitable bill,
which, as he told the story, Patrick Henry supported
with an eloquence so irresistible that it
was carried through the House without an opposing
vote; while a notorious speculator in these very
certificates, having listened from the gallery to
Patrick Henry&#8217;s speech, at its conclusion so far
forgot his own interest in the question as to exclaim,
&#8220;That bill ought to pass.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor339" id="FNanchor339"></a><a href="#Footnote-339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>Concerning his appearance and his manner of
speech in those days, a bit of testimony comes
down to us from Spencer Roane, who, as he tells
us, first &#8220;met with Patrick Henry in the Assembly
of 1783.&#8221; He adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;I also then met with R. H. Lee.&hellip; I lodged with
Lee one or two sessions, and was perfectly acquainted
with him, while I was yet a stranger to Mr. H. These
two gentlemen were the great leaders in the House of
Delegates, and were almost constantly opposed. Notwithstanding
my habits of intimacy with Mr. Lee, I
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
found myself obliged to vote with P. H. against him in
&#8217;83, and against Madison in &#8217;84, &hellip; but with several
important exceptions. I voted against him (P. H.), I
recollect, on the subject of the refugees,&mdash;he was for
permitting their return; on the subject of a general
assessment; and the act incorporating the Episcopal
Church. I voted with him, in general, because he was,
I thought, a more practical statesman than Madison
(time has made Madison more practical), and a less
selfish one than Lee. As an orator, Mr. Henry demolished
Madison with as much ease as Samson did the
cords that bound him before he was shorn. Mr. Lee
held a greater competition.&hellip; Mr. Lee was a polished
gentleman. His person was not very good; and he had
lost the use of one of his hands; but his manner was
perfectly graceful. His language was always chaste,
and, although somewhat too monotonous, his speeches
were always pleasing; yet he did not ravish your senses,
nor carry away your judgment by storm.&hellip; Henry
was almost always victorious. He was as much superior
to Lee in temper as in eloquence.&hellip; Mr. Henry was
inferior to Lee in the gracefulness of his action, and
perhaps also in the chasteness of his language; yet his
language was seldom incorrect, and his address always
striking. He had a fine blue eye; and an earnest manner
which made it impossible not to attend to him. His
speaking was unequal, and always rose with the subject
and the exigency. In this respect, he entirely differed
from Mr. Lee, who always was equal. At some times,
Mr. Henry would seem to hobble, especially in the beginning
of his speeches; and, at others, his tones would
be almost disagreeable; yet it was by means of his
tones, and the happy modulation of his voice, that his
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
speaking perhaps had its greatest effect. He had a
happy articulation, and a clear, distinct, strong voice;
and every syllable was distinctly uttered. He was very
unassuming as to himself, amounting almost to humility,
and very respectful towards his competitor; the consequence
was that no feeling of disgust or animosity was
arrayed against him. His exordiums in particular were
often hobbling and always unassuming. He knew mankind
too well to promise much.&hellip; He was great at a
reply, and greater in proportion to the pressure which
was bearing upon him. The resources of his mind and
of his eloquence were equal to any drafts which could
be made upon them. He took but short notes of what
fell from his adversaries, and disliked the drudgery of
composition; yet it is a mistake to say that he could
not write well.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor340" id="FNanchor340"></a><a href="#Footnote-340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII <br />
<span class="hsub">SHALL THE CONFEDERATION BE MADE STRONGER?</span></h2>


<p>We have now arrived at the second period of
Patrick Henry&#8217;s service as governor of Virginia,
beginning with the 30th of November, 1784. For
the four or five years immediately following that
date, the salient facts in his career seem to group
themselves around the story of his relation to that
vast national movement which ended in an entire
reorganization of the American Republic under a
new Constitution. Whoever will take the trouble
to examine the evidence now at hand bearing upon
the case, can hardly fail to convince himself that
the true story of Patrick Henry&#8217;s opposition to
that great movement has never yet been told. Men
have usually misconceived, when they have not altogether
overlooked, the motives for his opposition,
the spirit in which he conducted it, and the beneficent
effects which were accomplished by it; while
his ultimate and firm approval of the new Constitution,
after it had received the chief amendments
called for by his criticisms, has been passionately
described as an example of gross political fickleness
and inconsistency, instead of being, as it really
was, a most logical proceeding on his part, and in
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
perfect harmony with the principles underlying his
whole public career.</p>

<p>Before entering on a story so fascinating for the
light it throws on the man and on the epoch, it is
well that we should stay long enough to glance at
what we may call the incidental facts in his life,
for these four or five years now to be looked into.</p>

<p>Not far from the time of his thus entering once
more upon the office of governor, occurred the
death of his aged mother, at the home of his
brother-in-law, Colonel Samuel Meredith of Winton,
who, in a letter to the governor, dated November
22, 1784, speaks tenderly of the long illness
which had preceded the death of the venerable
lady, and especially of the strength and beauty of
her character:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;She has been in my family upwards of eleven years;
and from the beginning of that time to the end, her life
appeared to me most evidently to be a continued manifestation
of piety and devotion, guided by such a great
share of good sense as rendered her amiable and agreeable
to all who were so happy as to be acquainted with
her. Never have I known a Christian character equal
to hers.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor341" id="FNanchor341"></a><a href="#Footnote-341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p></div>

<p>On bringing his family to the capital, in November,
1784, from the far-away solitude of Leatherwood,
the governor established them, not within
the city itself, but across the James River, at a
place called Salisbury. What with children and
with grandchildren, his family had now become
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
a patriarchal one; and some slight glimpse of
himself and of his manner of life at that time is
given us in the memorandum of Spencer Roane.
In deference to &#8220;the ideas attached to the office of
governor, as handed down from the royal government,&#8221;
he is said to have paid careful attention to
his costume and personal bearing before the public,
never going abroad except in black coat, waistcoat,
and knee-breeches, in scarlet cloak, and in dressed
wig. Moreover, his family &#8220;were furnished with
an excellent coach, at a time when these vehicles
were not so common as at present. They lived as
genteelly, and associated with as polished society,
as that of any governor before or since has ever
done. He entertained as much company as others,
and in as genteel a style; and when, at the end of
two years, he resigned the office, he had greatly
exceeded the salary, and [was] in debt, which was
one cause that induced him to resume the practice
of the law.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor342" id="FNanchor342"></a><a href="#Footnote-342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>During his two years in the governorship, his
duties concerned matters of much local importance,
indeed, but of no particular interest at present. To
this remark one exception may be found in some
passages of friendly correspondence between the
governor and Washington,&mdash;the latter then enjoying
the long-coveted repose of Mt. Vernon. In
January, 1785, the Assembly of Virginia vested in
Washington certain shares in two companies, just
then formed, for opening and extending the navigation
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
of the James and Potomac rivers.<a name="FNanchor343" id="FNanchor343"></a><a href="#Footnote-343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> In response
to Governor Henry&#8217;s letter communicating
this act, Washington wrote on the 27th of February,
stating his doubts about accepting such a gratuity,
but at the same time asking the governor as
a friend to assist him in the matter by his advice.
Governor Henry&#8217;s reply is of interest to us, not
only for its allusion to his own domestic anxieties
at the time, but for its revelation of the frank and
cordial relations between the two men:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right1"><span class="smcap">Richmond</span>, March 12th, 1785.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The honor you are pleased to do me,
in your favor of the 27th ultimo, in which you desire my
opinion in a friendly way concerning the act enclosed
you lately, is very flattering to me. I did not receive
the letter till Thursday, and since that my family has
been very sickly. My oldest grandson, a fine boy indeed,
about nine years old, lays at the point of death.
Under this state of uneasiness and perturbation, I feel
some unfitness to consider a subject of so delicate a nature
as that you have desired my thoughts on. Besides,
I have some expectation of a conveyance more proper,
it may be, than the present, when I would wish to send
you some packets received from Ireland, which I fear
the post cannot carry at once. If he does not take them
free, I shan&#8217;t send them, for they are heavy. Captain
Boyle, who had them from Sir Edward Newenham,
wishes for the honor of a line from you, which I have
promised to forward to him.</p>

<p>I will give you the trouble of hearing from me next
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
post, if no opportunity presents sooner, and, in the mean
time, I beg you to be persuaded that, with the most
sincere attachment, I am, dear sir, your most obedient
servant,</p>

<p class="right1">
<span class="smcap">P. Henry.</span><a name="FNanchor344" id="FNanchor344"></a><a href="#Footnote-344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Washington.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The promise contained in this letter was fulfilled
on the 19th of the same month, when the governor
wrote to Washington a long and careful statement
of the whole case, urging him to accept the shares,
and closing his letter with an assurance of his
&#8220;unalterable affection&#8221; and &#8220;most sincere attachment,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor345" id="FNanchor345"></a><a href="#Footnote-345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>&mdash;a
subscription not common among public
men at that time.</p>

<p>On the 30th of November, 1786, having declined
to be put in nomination for a third year, as permitted
by the Constitution, he finally retired from
the office of governor. The House of Delegates,
about the same time, by unanimous vote, crowned
him with the public thanks, &#8220;for his wise, prudent,
and upright administration, during his last
appointment of chief magistrate of this Commonwealth;
assuring him that they retain a perfect
sense of his abilities in the discharge of the duties
of that high and important office, and wish him all
domestic happiness on his return to private life.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor346" id="FNanchor346"></a><a href="#Footnote-346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>This return to private life meant, among other
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
things, his return, after an interruption of more
than twelve years, to the practice of the law. For
this purpose he deemed it best to give up his remote
home at Leatherwood, and to establish himself
in Prince Edward County,&mdash;a place about
midway between his former residence and the capital,
and much better suited to his convenience, as
an active practitioner in the courts. Accordingly,
in Prince Edward County he continued to reside
from the latter part of 1786 until 1795. Furthermore,
by that county he was soon elected as one of
its delegates in the Assembly; and, resuming there
his old position as leader, he continued to serve in
every session until the end of 1790, at which time
he finally withdrew from all official connection
with public life. Thus it happened that, by his
retirement from the governorship in 1786, and by
his almost immediate restoration to the House of
Delegates, he was put into a situation to act most
aggressively and most powerfully on public opinion
in Virginia during the whole period of the struggle
over the new Constitution.</p>

<p>As regards his attitude toward that great business,
we need, first of all, to clear away some obscurity
which has gathered about the question of
his habitual views respecting the relations of the
several States to the general government. It has
been common to suppose that, even prior to the
movement for the new Constitution, Patrick Henry
had always been an extreme advocate of the rights
of the States as opposed to the central authority
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
of the Union; and that the tremendous resistance
which he made to the new Constitution in all stages
of the affair prior to the adoption of the first
group of amendments is to be accounted for as the
effect of an original and habitual tendency of his
mind.<a name="FNanchor347" id="FNanchor347"></a><a href="#Footnote-347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> Such, however, seems not to have been the
case.</p>

<p>In general it may be said that, at the very outset
of the Revolution, Patrick Henry was one of the
first of our statesmen to recognize the existence
and the imperial character of a certain cohesive
central authority, arising from the very nature of
the revolutionary act which the several colonies
were then taking. As early as 1774, in the first
Continental Congress, it was he who exclaimed:
&#8220;All distinctions are thrown down. All America
is thrown into one mass.&#8221; &#8220;The distinctions between
Virginians, Pennsylvanians, New Yorkers,
and New Englanders are no more. I am not a
Virginian, but an American.&#8221; In the spring of
1776, at the approach of the question of independence,
it was he who even incurred reproach by his
anxiety to defer independence until after the basis
for a general government should have been established,
lest the several States, in separating from
England, should lapse into a separation from one
another also. As governor of Virginia from 1776
to 1779, his official correspondence with the president
of Congress, with the board of war, and with
the general of the army is pervaded by proofs of
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
his respect for the supreme authority of the general
government within its proper sphere. Finally,
as a leader in the Virginia House of Delegates
from 1780 to 1784, he was in the main a supporter
of the policy of giving more strength and dignity
to the general government. During all that period,
according to the admission of his most unfriendly
modern critic, Patrick Henry showed himself &#8220;much
more disposed to sustain and strengthen the federal
authority&#8221; than did, for example, his great rival in
the House, Richard Henry Lee; and for the time
those two great men became &#8220;the living and active
exponents of two adverse political systems in both
state and national questions.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor348" id="FNanchor348"></a><a href="#Footnote-348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> In 1784, by which
time the weakness of the general government had
become alarming, Patrick Henry was among the
foremost in Virginia to express alarm, and to propose
the only appropriate remedy. For example,
on the assembling of the legislature, in May of
that year, he took pains to seek an early interview
with two of his prominent associates in the House
of Delegates, Madison and Jones, for the express
purpose of devising with them some method of giving
greater strength to the Confederation. &#8220;I find
him,&#8221; wrote Madison to Jefferson immediately
after the interview, &#8220;strenuous for invigorating
the federal government, though without any precise
plan.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor349" id="FNanchor349"></a><a href="#Footnote-349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> A more detailed account of the same
interview was sent to Jefferson by another correspondent.<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
According to the latter, Patrick Henry
then declared that &#8220;he saw ruin inevitable, unless
something was done to give Congress a compulsory
process on delinquent States;&#8221; that &#8220;a bold example
set by Virginia&#8221; in that direction &#8220;would
have influence on the other States;&#8221; and that
&#8220;this conviction was his only inducement for coming
into the present Assembly.&#8221; Whereupon, it
was then agreed between them that &#8220;Jones and
Madison should sketch some plan for giving greater
power to the federal government; and Henry
promised to sustain it on the floor.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor350" id="FNanchor350"></a><a href="#Footnote-350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> Finally, such
was the impression produced by Patrick Henry&#8217;s
political conduct during all those years that, as late
as in December, 1786, Madison could speak of him
as having &#8220;been hitherto the champion of the federal
cause.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor351" id="FNanchor351"></a><a href="#Footnote-351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>Not far, however, from the date last mentioned
Patrick Henry ceased to be &#8220;the champion of the
federal cause,&#8221; and became its chief antagonist,
and so remained until some time during Washington&#8217;s
first term in the presidency. What brought
about this sudden and total revolution? It can be
explained only by the discovery of some new influence
which came into his life between 1784 and
1786, and which was powerful enough to reverse
entirely the habitual direction of his political
thought and conduct. Just what that influence
was can now be easily shown.<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 3d of August, 1786, John Jay, as secretary
for foreign affairs, presented to Congress
some results of his negotiations with the Spanish
envoy, Gardoqui, respecting a treaty with Spain;
and he then urged that Congress, in view of certain
vast advantages to our foreign commerce,
should consent to surrender the navigation of the
Mississippi for twenty-five or thirty years,<a name="FNanchor352" id="FNanchor352"></a><a href="#Footnote-352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>&mdash;a
proposal which, very naturally, seemed to the six
Southern States as nothing less than a cool invitation
to them to sacrifice their own most important
interests for the next quarter of a century, in order
to build up during that period the interests of the
seven States of the North. The revelation of this
project, and of the ability of the Northern States
to force it through, sent a shock of alarm and of
distrust into every Southern community. Moreover,
full details of these transactions in Congress
were promptly conveyed to Governor Henry by
James Monroe, who added this pungent item,&mdash;that
a secret project was then under the serious
consideration of &#8220;committees&#8221; of Northern men,
for a dismemberment of the Union, and for setting
the Southern States adrift, after having thus bartered
away from them the use of the Mississippi.<a name="FNanchor353" id="FNanchor353"></a><a href="#Footnote-353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p>On the same day that Monroe was writing
from New York that letter to Governor Henry,
Madison was writing from Philadelphia a letter to
Jefferson. Having mentioned a plan for strengthening
the Confederation, Madison says:&mdash;<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Though my wishes are in favor of such an event,
yet I despair so much of its accomplishment at the
present crisis, that I do not extend my views beyond
a commercial reform. To speak the truth, I almost
despair even of this. You will find the cause in a measure
now before Congress, &hellip; a proposed treaty with
Spain, one article of which shuts the Mississippi for
twenty or thirty years. Passing by the other Southern
States, figure to yourself the effect of such a stipulation
on the Assembly of Virginia, already jealous of Northern
politics, and which will be composed of thirty members
from the Western waters,&mdash;of a majority of others
attached to the Western country from interests of their
own, of their friends, or their constituents.&hellip; Figure
to yourself its effect on the people at large on the Western
waters, who are impatiently waiting for a favorable
result to the negotiation with Gardoqui, and who will consider
themselves sold by their Atlantic brethren. Will
it be an unnatural consequence if they consider themselves
absolved from every federal tie, and court some
protection for their betrayed rights?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor354" id="FNanchor354"></a><a href="#Footnote-354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p></div>

<p>How truly Madison predicted the fatal construction
which in the South, and particularly in Virginia,
would be put upon the proposed surrender
of the Mississippi, may be seen by a glance at
some of the resolutions which passed the Virginia
House of Delegates on the 29th of the following
November:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;That the common right of navigating the river
Mississippi, and of communicating with other nations
through that channel, ought to be considered as the
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
bountiful gift of nature to the United States, as proprietors
of the territories watered by the said river and its
eastern branches, and as moreover secured to them by
the late revolution.</p>

<p>&#8220;That the Confederacy, having been formed on the
broad basis of equal rights, in every part thereof, to the
protection and guardianship of the whole, a sacrifice of
the rights of any one part, to the supposed or real interest
of another part, would be a flagrant violation of justice,
a direct contravention of the end for which the
federal government was instituted, and an alarming innovation
in the system of the Union.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor355" id="FNanchor355"></a><a href="#Footnote-355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p></div>

<p>One day after the passage of those resolutions,
Patrick Henry ceased to be the governor of Virginia;
and five days afterward he was chosen by
Virginia as one of its seven delegates to a convention
to be held at Philadelphia in the following
May for the purpose of revising the federal Constitution.
But amid the widespread excitement,
amid the anger and the suspicion then prevailing
as to the liability of the Southern States, even
under a weak confederation, to be slaughtered, in
all their most important concerns, by the superior
weight and number of the Northern States, it is
easy to see how little inclined many Southern
statesmen would be to increase that liability by
making this weak confederation a strong one. In
the list of such Southern statesmen Patrick Henry
must henceforth be reckoned; and, as it was never
his nature to do anything tepidly or by halves, his
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
hostility to the project for strengthening the Confederation
soon became as hot as it was comprehensive.
On the 7th of December, only three
days after he was chosen as a delegate to the
Philadelphia convention, Madison, then at Richmond,
wrote concerning him thus anxiously to
Washington:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;I am entirely convinced from what I observe here,
that unless the project of Congress can be reversed, the
hopes of carrying this State into a proper federal system
will be demolished. Many of our most federal leading
men are extremely soured with what has already passed.
Mr. Henry, who has been hitherto the champion of the
federal cause, has become a cold advocate, and, in the
event of an actual sacrifice of the Mississippi by Congress,
will unquestionably go over to the opposite side.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor356" id="FNanchor356"></a><a href="#Footnote-356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p></div>

<p>But in spite of this change in his attitude toward
the federal cause, perhaps he would still go
to the great convention. On that subject he appears
to have kept his own counsel for several
weeks; but by the 1st of March, 1787, Edmund
Randolph, at Richmond, was able to send this
word to Madison, who was back in his place in
Congress: &#8220;Mr. Henry peremptorily refuses to
go;&#8221; and Randolph mentions as Henry&#8217;s reasons
for this refusal, not only his urgent professional
duties, but his repugnance to the proceedings of
Congress in the matter of the Mississippi.<a name="FNanchor357" id="FNanchor357"></a><a href="#Footnote-357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> Five
days later, from the same city, John Marshall
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
wrote to Arthur Lee: &#8220;Mr. Henry, whose opinions
have their usual influence, has been heard to
say that he would rather part with the Confederation
than relinquish the navigation of the Mississippi.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor358" id="FNanchor358"></a><a href="#Footnote-358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>
On the 18th of the same month, in a
letter to Washington, Madison poured out his solicitude
respecting the course which Henry was
going to take: &#8220;I hear from Richmond, with
much concern, that Mr. Henry has positively declined
his mission to Philadelphia. Besides the
loss of his services on that theatre, there is danger,
I fear, that this step has proceeded from a wish
to leave his conduct unfettered on another theatre,
where the result of the convention will receive its
destiny from his omnipotence.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor359" id="FNanchor359"></a><a href="#Footnote-359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> On the next day,
Madison sent off to Jefferson, who was then in
Paris, an account of the situation: &#8220;But although
it appears that the intended sacrifice of the Mississippi
will not be made, the consequences of the
intention and the attempt are likely to be very
serious. I have already made known to you the
light in which the subject was taken up by Virginia.
Mr. Henry&#8217;s disgust exceeds all measure,
and I am not singular in ascribing his refusal to
attend the convention, to the policy of keeping
himself free to combat or espouse the result of it
according to the result of the Mississippi business,
among other circumstances.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor360" id="FNanchor360"></a><a href="#Footnote-360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>


<p><span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
Finally, on the 25th of March Madison wrote to
Randolph, evidently in reply to the information
given by the latter on the 1st of the month: &#8220;The
refusal of Mr. Henry to join in the task of revising
the Confederation is ominous; and the more
so, I fear, if he means to be governed by the event
which you conjecture.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor361" id="FNanchor361"></a><a href="#Footnote-361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>That Patrick Henry did not attend the great
convention, everybody knows; but the whole meaning
of his refusal to do so, everybody may now
understand somewhat more clearly, perhaps, than
before.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII <br />
<span class="hsub">THE BATTLE IN VIRGINIA OVER THE NEW CONSTITUTION</span></h2>


<p>The great convention at Philadelphia, after a
session of four months, came to the end of its
noble labors on the 17th of September, 1787.
Washington, who had been not merely its presiding
officer but its presiding genius, then hastened
back to Mt. Vernon, and, in his great anxiety to
win over to the new Constitution the support of
his old friend Patrick Henry, he immediately dispatched
to him a copy of that instrument, accompanied
by a very impressive and conciliatory letter,<a name="FNanchor362" id="FNanchor362"></a><a href="#Footnote-362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
to which, about three weeks afterwards, was
returned the following reply:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right1"><span class="smcap">Richmond</span>, October 19, 1787.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I was honored by the receipt of your
favor, together with a copy of the proposed federal Constitution,
a few days ago, for which I beg you to accept
my thanks. They are also due to you from me as a
citizen, on account of the great fatigue necessarily attending
the arduous business of the late convention.</p>

<p>I have to lament that I cannot bring my mind to
accord with the proposed Constitution. The concern I
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
feel on this account is really greater than I am able to
express. Perhaps mature reflections may furnish me
with reasons to change my present sentiments into a
conformity with the opinions of those personages for
whom I have the highest reverence. Be that as it may,
I beg you will be persuaded of the unalterable regard
and attachment with which I shall be,</p>

<p>Dear Sir, your obliged and very humble servant,</p>

<p class="right1">
<span class="smcap">P. Henry.</span><a name="FNanchor363" id="FNanchor363"></a><a href="#Footnote-363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>
</p></div>

<p>Four days before the date of this letter the
legislature of Virginia had convened at Richmond
for its autumn session, and Patrick Henry had
there taken his usual place on the most important
committees, and as the virtual director of the
thought and work of the House. Much solicitude
was felt concerning the course which he might advise
the legislature to adopt on the supreme question
then before the country,&mdash;some persons even
fearing that he might try to defeat the new Constitution
in Virginia by simply preventing the call
of a state convention. Great was Washington&#8217;s
satisfaction on receiving from one of his correspondents
in the Assembly, shortly after the session
began, this cheerful report:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;I have not met with one in all my inquiries (and I
have made them with great diligence) opposed to it,
except Mr. Henry, who I have heard is so, but could
only conjecture it from a conversation with him on the
subject.&hellip; The transmissory note of Congress was
before us to-day, when Mr. Henry declared that it
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
transcended our powers to decide on the Constitution,
and that it must go before a convention. As it was insinuated
he would aim at preventing this, much pleasure
was discovered at the declaration.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor364" id="FNanchor364"></a><a href="#Footnote-364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p></div>

<p>On the 24th of October, from his place in Congress,
Madison sent over to Jefferson, in Paris, a
full account of the results of the Philadelphia convention,
and of the public feeling with reference
to its work: &#8220;My information from Virginia is
as yet extremely imperfect.&hellip; The part which
Mr. Henry will take is unknown here. Much will
depend on it. I had taken it for granted, from a
variety of circumstances, that he would be in the
opposition, and still think that will be the case.
There are reports, however, which favor a contrary
supposition.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor365" id="FNanchor365"></a><a href="#Footnote-365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> But, by the 9th of December,
Madison was able to send to Jefferson a further
report, which indicated that all doubt respecting
the hostile attitude of Patrick Henry was then
removed. After mentioning that a majority of
the people of Virginia seemed to be in favor of the
Constitution, he added: &#8220;What change may be
produced by the united influence and exertions of
Mr. Henry, Mr. Mason, and the governor, with
some pretty able auxiliaries, is uncertain.&hellip;
Mr. Henry is the great adversary who will render
the event precarious. He is, I find, with his usual
address, working up every possible interest into a
spirit of opposition.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor366" id="FNanchor366"></a><a href="#Footnote-366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>


<p>Long before the date last mentioned, the legislature<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
had regularly declared for a state convention,
to be held at Richmond on the first Monday in
June, 1788, then and there to determine whether
or not Virginia would accept the new Constitution.
In view of that event, delegates were in the mean
time to be chosen by the people; and thus, for the
intervening months, the fight was to be transferred
to the arena of popular debate. In such a contest
Patrick Henry, being once aroused, was not likely
to take a languid or a hesitating part; and of the
importance then attached to the part which he did
take, we catch frequent glimpses in the correspondence
of the period. Thus, on the 19th of February,
1788, Madison, still at New York, sent this
word to Jefferson: &#8220;The temper of Virginia, as
far as I can learn, has undergone but little change
of late. At first, there was an enthusiasm for the
Constitution. The tide next took a sudden and
strong turn in the opposite direction. The influence
and exertions of Mr. Henry, Colonel Mason,
and some others, will account for this.&hellip; I am
told that a very bold language is held by Mr.
Henry and some of his partisans.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor367" id="FNanchor367"></a><a href="#Footnote-367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> On the 10th
of April, Madison, then returned to his home in
Virginia, wrote to Edmund Randolph: &#8220;The declaration
of Henry, mentioned in your letter, is a
proof to me that desperate measures will be his
game.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor368" id="FNanchor368"></a><a href="#Footnote-368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> On the 22d of the same month Madison
wrote to Jefferson: &#8220;The adversaries take very<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
different grounds of opposition. Some are opposed
to the substance of the plan; others, to particular
modifications only. Mr. Henry is supposed to aim
at disunion.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor369" id="FNanchor369"></a><a href="#Footnote-369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> On the 24th of April, Edward
Carrington, writing from New York, told Jefferson:
&#8220;Mr. H. does not openly declare for a dismemberment
of the Union, but his arguments in
support of his opposition to the Constitution go
directly to that issue. He says that three confederacies
would be practicable, and better suited to
the good of commerce than one.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor370" id="FNanchor370"></a><a href="#Footnote-370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> On the 28th
of April, Washington wrote to Lafayette on account
of the struggle then going forward; and
after naming some of the leading champions of the
Constitution, he adds sorrowfully: &#8220;Henry and
Mason are its great adversaries.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor371" id="FNanchor371"></a><a href="#Footnote-371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> Finally, as
late as on the 12th of June, the Rev. John Blair
Smith, at that time president of Hampden-Sidney
College, conveyed to Madison, an old college friend,
his own deep disapproval of the course which had
been pursued by Patrick Henry in the management
of the canvass against the Constitution:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Before the Constitution appeared, the minds of the
people were artfully prepared against it; so that all
opposition [to Mr. Henry] at the election of delegates to
consider it, was in vain. That gentleman has descended
to lower artifices and management on the occasion than
I thought him capable of.&hellip; If Mr. Innes has shown
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
you a speech of Mr. Henry to his constituents, which I
sent him, you will see something of the method he has
taken to diffuse his poison.&hellip; It grieves me to see
such great natural talents abused to such purposes.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor372" id="FNanchor372"></a><a href="#Footnote-372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p></div>

<p>On Monday, the 2d of June, 1788, the long-expected
convention assembled at Richmond. So
great was the public interest in the event that a
full delegation was present, even on the first day;
and in order to make room for the throngs of citizens
from all parts of Virginia and from other
States, who had flocked thither to witness the impending
battle, it was decided that the convention
should hold its meetings in the New Academy, on
Shockoe Hill, the largest assembly-room in the
city.</p>

<p>Eight States had already adopted the Constitution.
The five States which had yet to act upon
the question were New Hampshire, Rhode Island,
New York, North Carolina, and Virginia. For
every reason, the course then to be taken by Virginia
would have great consequences. Moreover,
since the days of the struggle over independence,
no question had so profoundly moved the people of
Virginia; none had aroused such hopes and such
fears; none had so absorbed the thoughts, or so
embittered the relations of men. It is not strange,
therefore, that this convention, consisting of one
hundred and seventy members, should have been
thought to represent, to an unusual degree, the intelligence,
the character, the experience, the reputation
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
of the State. Perhaps it would be true to
say that, excepting Washington, Jefferson, and
Richard Henry Lee, no Virginian of eminence was
absent from it.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the line of division, which from
the outset parted into two hostile sections these
one hundred and seventy Virginians, was something
quite unparalleled. In other States it had been
noted that the conservative classes, the men of education
and of property, of high office, of high social
and professional standing, were nearly all on the
side of the new Constitution. Such was not the
case in Virginia. Of the conservative classes
throughout that State, quite as many were against
the new Constitution as were in favor of it. Of
the four distinguished citizens who had been its
governors, since Virginia had assumed the right to
elect governors,&mdash;Patrick Henry, Jefferson, Nelson,
and Harrison,&mdash;each in turn had denounced
the measure as unsatisfactory and dangerous;
while Edmund Randolph, the governor then in
office, having attended the great convention at
Philadelphia, and having there refused to sign the
Constitution, had published an impressive statement
of his objections to it, and, for several months
thereafter, had been counted among its most formidable
opponents. Concerning the attitude of the
legal profession,&mdash;a profession always inclined to
conservatism,&mdash;Madison had written to Jefferson:
&#8220;The general and admiralty courts, with most of
the bar, oppose the Constitution.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor373" id="FNanchor373"></a><a href="#Footnote-373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> Finally, among
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
Virginians who were at that time particularly honored
and trusted for patriotic services during the
Revolution, such men as these, Theodoric Bland,
William Grayson, John Tyler, Meriwether Smith,
James Monroe, George Mason, and Richard Henry
Lee, had declared their disapproval of the document.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, within the convention itself, at the
opening of the session, it was claimed by the friends
of the new government that they then outnumbered
their opponents by at least fifty votes.<a name="FNanchor374" id="FNanchor374"></a><a href="#Footnote-374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Their
great champion in debate was James Madison, who
was powerfully assisted, first or last, by Edmund
Pendleton, John Marshall, George Nicholas, Francis
Corbin, George Wythe, James Innes, General
Henry Lee, and especially by that same Governor
Randolph who, after denouncing the Constitution
for &#8220;features so odious&#8221; that he could not &#8220;agree
to it,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor375" id="FNanchor375"></a><a href="#Footnote-375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> had finally swung completely around to its
support.</p>

<p>Against all this array of genius, learning, character,
logical acumen, and eloquence, Patrick Henry
held the field as protagonist for twenty-three days,&mdash;his
chief lieutenants in the fight being Mason,
Grayson, and John Dawson, with occasional help
from Harrison, Monroe, and Tyler. Upon him
alone fell the brunt of the battle. Out of the
twenty-three days of that splendid tourney, there
were but five days in which he did not take the
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
floor. On each of several days he made three
speeches; on one day he made five speeches; on
another day eight. In one speech alone, he was on
his legs for seven hours. The words of all who
had any share in that debate were taken down,
according to the imperfect art of the time, by
the stenographer, David Robertson, whose reports,
however, are said to be little more than a pretty
full outline of the speeches actually made: but in
the volume which contains these abstracts, one of
Patrick Henry&#8217;s speeches fills eight pages, another
ten pages, another sixteen, another twenty-one,
another forty; while, in the aggregate, his speeches
constitute nearly one quarter of the entire book,&mdash;a
book of six hundred and sixty-three pages.<a name="FNanchor376" id="FNanchor376"></a><a href="#Footnote-376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>Any one who has fallen under the impression, so
industriously propagated by the ingenious enmity
of Jefferson&#8217;s old age, that Patrick Henry was a
man of but meagre information and of extremely
slender intellectual resources, ignorant especially
of law, of political science, and of history, totally
lacking in logical power and in precision of statement,
with nothing to offset these deficiencies excepting
a strange gift of overpowering, dithyrambic
eloquence, will find it hard, as he turns over the
leaves on which are recorded the debates of the
Virginia convention, to understand just how such
a person could have made the speeches which are
there attributed to Patrick Henry, or how a mere
rhapsodist could have thus held his ground, in close
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
hand-to-hand combat, for twenty-three days, against
such antagonists, on all the difficult subjects of
law, political science, and history involved in the
Constitution of the United States,&mdash;while showing
at the same time every quality of good generalship
as a tactician and as a party leader. &#8220;There has
been, I am aware,&#8221; says an eminent historian of
the Constitution, &#8220;a modern scepticism concerning
Patrick Henry&#8217;s abilities; but I cannot share it.&hellip;
The manner in which he carried on the opposition
to the Constitution in the convention of Virginia,
for nearly a whole month, shows that he possessed
other powers besides those of great natural
eloquence.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor377" id="FNanchor377"></a><a href="#Footnote-377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>But, now, what were Patrick Henry&#8217;s objections
to the new Constitution?</p>

<p>First of all, let it be noted that his objections
did not spring from any hostility to the union of
the thirteen States, or from any preference for a
separate union of the Southern States. Undoubtedly
there had been a time, especially under the
provocations connected with the Mississippi business,
when he and many other Southern statesmen
sincerely thought that there might be no security
for their interests even under the Confederation,
and that this lack of security would be even more
glaring and disastrous under the new Constitution.
Such, for example, seems to have been the opinion
of Governor Benjamin Harrison, as late as October
the 4th, 1787, on which date he thus wrote to
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
Washington: &#8220;I cannot divest myself of an opinion
that &hellip; if the Constitution is carried into
effect, the States south of the Potomac will be
little more than appendages to those to the northward
of it.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor378" id="FNanchor378"></a><a href="#Footnote-378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> It is very probable that this sentence
accurately reflects, likewise, Patrick Henry&#8217;s
mood of thought at that time. Nevertheless, whatever
may have been his thought under the sectional
suspicions and alarms of the preceding months, it
is certain that, at the date of the Virginia convention,
he had come to see that the thirteen States
must, by all means, try to keep together. &#8220;I am
persuaded,&#8221; said he, in reply to Randolph, &#8220;of
what the honorable gentleman says, &#8216;that separate
confederacies will ruin us.&#8217;&#8221; &#8220;Sir,&#8221; he exclaimed
on another occasion, &#8220;the dissolution of the Union
is most abhorrent to my mind. The first thing I
have at heart is American liberty; the second
thing is American union.&#8221; Again he protested:
&#8220;I mean not to breathe the spirit, nor utter the
language, of secession.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor379" id="FNanchor379"></a><a href="#Footnote-379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>In the second place, he admitted that there were
great defects in the old Confederation, and that
those defects ought to be cured by proper amendments,
particularly in the direction of greater
strength to the federal government. But did the
proposed Constitution embody such amendments?
On the contrary, that Constitution, instead of properly
amending the old Confederation, simply annihilated
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
it, and replaced it by something radically
different and radically dangerous.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The federal convention ought to have amended the
old system; for this purpose they were solely delegated;
the object of their mission extended to no other consideration.&#8221;
&#8220;The distinction between a national government
and a confederacy is not sufficiently discerned.
Had the delegates who were sent to Philadelphia a
power to propose a consolidated government, instead of
a confederacy?&#8221; &#8220;Here is a resolution as radical as
that which separated us from Great Britain. It is radical
in this transition; our rights and privileges are
endangered, and the sovereignty of the States will be
relinquished: and cannot we plainly see that this is
actually the case? The rights of conscience, trial by
jury, liberty of the press, all your immunities and franchises,
all pretensions to human rights and privileges,
are rendered insecure, if not lost, by this change, so
loudly talked of by some, so inconsiderately by others.&#8221;
&#8220;A number of characters, of the greatest eminence in
this country, object to this government for its consolidating
tendency. This is not imaginary. It is a formidable
reality. If consolidation proves to be as mischievous
to this country as it has been to other countries,
what will the poor inhabitants of this country do? This
government will operate like an ambuscade. It will
destroy the state governments, and swallow the liberties
of the people, without giving previous notice. If gentlemen
are willing to run the hazard, let them run it; but
I shall exculpate myself by my opposition and monitory
warnings within these walls.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor380" id="FNanchor380"></a><a href="#Footnote-380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
But, in the third place, besides transforming the
old confederacy into a centralized and densely consolidated
government, and clothing that government
with enormous powers over States and over
individuals, what had this new Constitution provided
for the protection of States and of individuals?
Almost nothing. It had created a new and
a tremendous power over us; it had failed to cover
us with any shield, or to interpose any barrier, by
which, in case of need, we might save ourselves
from the wanton and fatal exercise of that power.
In short, the new Constitution had no bill of
rights. But &#8220;a bill of rights,&#8221; he declared, is
&#8220;indispensably necessary.&#8221;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;A general positive provision should be inserted in
the new system, securing to the States and the people
every right which was not conceded to the general government.&#8221;
&#8220;I trust that gentlemen, on this occasion,
will see the great objects of religion, liberty of the press,
trial by jury, interdiction of cruel punishments, and
every other sacred right, secured, before they agree to
that paper.&#8221; &#8220;Mr. Chairman, the necessity of a bill of
rights appears to me to be greater in this government
than ever it was in any government before. I have observed
already that the sense of European nations, and
particularly Great Britain, is against the construction
of rights being retained which are not expressly relinquished.
I repeat, that all nations have adopted the
construction, that all rights not expressly and unequivocally
reserved to the people are impliedly and incidentally
relinquished to rulers, as necessarily inseparable
from delegated powers.&hellip; Let us consider the sentiments
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
which have been entertained by the people of
America on this subject. At the Revolution, it must be
admitted that it was their sense to set down those great
rights which ought, in all countries, to be held inviolable
and sacred. Virginia did so, we all remember. She
made a compact to reserve, expressly, certain rights.&hellip;
She most cautiously and guardedly reserved and secured
those invaluable, inestimable rights and privileges which
no people, inspired with the least glow of patriotic liberty,
ever did, or ever can, abandon. She is called
upon now to abandon them, and dissolve that compact
which secured them to her.&hellip; Will she do it? This
is the question. If you intend to reserve your unalienable
rights, you must have the most express stipulation;
for, if implication be allowed, you are ousted of those
rights. If the people do not think it necessary to reserve
them, they will be supposed to be given up.&hellip;
If you give up these powers, without a bill of rights, you
will exhibit the most absurd thing to mankind that ever
the world saw,&mdash;a government that has abandoned all
its powers,&mdash;the powers of direct taxation, the sword,
and the purse. You have disposed of them to Congress,
without a bill of rights, without check, limitation, or
control. And still you have checks and guards; still
you keep barriers&mdash;pointed where? Pointed against
your weakened, prostrated, enervated, state government!
You have a bill of rights to defend you against
the state government&mdash;which is bereaved of all power,
and yet you have none against Congress&mdash;though in
full and exclusive possession of all power. You arm
yourselves against the weak and defenceless, and expose
yourselves naked to the armed and powerful. Is not
this a conduct of unexampled absurdity?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor381" id="FNanchor381"></a><a href="#Footnote-381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
Again and again, in response to his demand for
an express assertion, in the instrument itself, of
the rights of individuals and of States, he was told
that every one of those rights was secured, since
it was naturally and fairly implied. &#8220;Even say,&#8221;
he rejoined, &#8220;it is a natural implication,&mdash;why
not give us a right &hellip; in express terms, in language
that could not admit of evasions or subterfuges?
If they can use implication for us, they
can also use implication against us. We are giving
power; they are getting power; judge, then, on
which side the implication will be used.&#8221; &#8220;Implication
is dangerous, because it is unbounded;
if it be admitted at all, and no limits prescribed,
it admits of the utmost extension.&#8221; &#8220;The existence
of powers is sufficiently established. If we
trust our dearest rights to implication, we shall be
in a very unhappy situation.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor382" id="FNanchor382"></a><a href="#Footnote-382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>Then, in addition to his objections to the general
character of the Constitution, namely, as a consolidated
government, unrestrained by an express guarantee
of rights, he applied his criticisms in great
detail, and with merciless rigor, to each department
of the proposed government,&mdash;the legislative, the
executive, and the judicial; and with respect to
each one of these he insisted that its intended
functions were such as to inspire distrust and alarm.
Of course, we cannot here follow this fierce critic
of the Constitution into all the detail of his criticisms;
but, as a single example, we may cite a
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
portion of his assault upon the executive department,&mdash;an
assault, as will be seen, far better suited
to the political apprehensions of his own time than
of ours:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The Constitution is said to have beautiful features;
but when I come to examine these features, sir, they
appear to me horribly frightful. Among other deformities,
it has an awful squinting; it squints towards monarchy.
And does not this raise indignation in the breast
of every true American? Your president may easily
become king.&hellip; Where are your checks in this government?
Your strongholds will be in the hands of
your enemies. It is on a supposition that your American
governors shall be honest, that all the good qualities of
this government are founded; but its defective and imperfect
construction puts it in their power to perpetrate
the worst of mischiefs, should they be bad men. And,
sir, would not all the world, from the eastern to the
western hemispheres, blame our distracted folly in resting
our rights upon the contingency of our rulers being good
or bad? Show me that age and country where the
rights and liberties of the people were placed on the sole
chance of their rulers being good men, without a consequent
loss of liberty.&hellip; If your American chief be
a man of ambition and abilities, how easy is it for him
to render himself absolute! The army is in his hands;
and if he be a man of address, it will be attached to
him, and it will be the subject of long meditation with
him to seize the first auspicious moment to accomplish
his design. And, sir, will the American spirit solely
relieve you when this happens? I would rather infinitely&mdash;and
I am sure most of this convention are of the
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
same opinion&mdash;have a king, lords, and commons, than
a government so replete with such insupportable evils.
If we make a king, we may prescribe the rules by which
he shall rule his people, and interpose such checks as
shall prevent him from infringing them; but the president,
in the field, at the head of his army, can prescribe
the terms on which he shall reign master, so far that
it will puzzle any American ever to get his neck from
under the galling yoke.&hellip; Will not the recollection
of his crimes teach him to make one bold push for the
American throne? Will not the immense difference
between being master of everything, and being ignominiously
tried and punished, powerfully excite him to
make this bold push? But, sir, where is the existing
force to punish him? Can he not, at the head of his
army, beat down every opposition? Away with your
president! we shall have a king. The army will salute
him monarch. Your militia will leave you, and assist
in making him king, and fight against you. And what
have you to oppose this force? What will then become
of you and your rights? Will not absolute despotism
ensue?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor383" id="FNanchor383"></a><a href="#Footnote-383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p></div>

<p>Without reproducing here, in further detail,
Patrick Henry&#8217;s objections to the new Constitution,
it may now be stated that they all sprang from
a single idea, and all revolved about that idea,
namely, that the new plan of government, as it
then stood, seriously endangered the rights and
liberties of the people of the several States. And
in holding this opinion he was not at all peculiar.
Very many of the ablest and noblest statesmen of
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
the time shared it with him. Not to name again
his chief associates in Virginia, nor to cite the language
of such men as Burke and Rawlins Lowndes,
of South Carolina; as Timothy Bloodworth, of
North Carolina; as Samuel Chase and Luther
Martin, of Maryland; as George Clinton, of New
York; as Samuel Adams, John Hancock, and Elbridge
Gerry, of Massachusetts; as Joshua Atherton,
of New Hampshire, it may sufficiently put us
into the tone of contemporary opinion upon the
subject, to recall certain grave words of Jefferson,
who, watching the whole scene from the calm distance
of Paris, thus wrote on the 2d of February,
1788, to an American friend:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;I own it astonishes me to find such a change wrought
in the opinions of our countrymen since I left them, as
that three fourths of them should be contented to live
under a system which leaves to their governors the power
of taking from them the trial by jury in civil cases,
freedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom of
commerce, the habeas corpus laws, and of yoking them
with a standing army. That is a degeneracy in the
principles of liberty, to which I had given four centuries,
instead of four years.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor384" id="FNanchor384"></a><a href="#Footnote-384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p></div>

<p>Holding such objections to the proposed Constitution,
what were Patrick Henry and his associates
in the Virginia convention to do? Were they to
reject the measure outright? Admitting that it
had some good features, they yet thought that the
best course to be taken by Virginia would be to
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
remit the whole subject to a new convention of
the States,&mdash;a convention which, being summoned
after a year or more of intense and universal discussion,
would thus represent the later, the more
definite, and the more enlightened desires of the
American people. But despairing of this, Patrick
Henry and his friends concentrated all their forces
upon this single and clear line of policy: so to
press their objections to the Constitution as to induce
the convention, not to reject it, but to postpone
its adoption until they could refer to the other
States in the American confederacy the following
momentous proposition, namely, &#8220;a declaration of
rights, asserting, and securing from encroachment,
the great principles of civil and religious liberty,
and the undeniable rights of the people, together
with amendments to the most exceptionable parts
of the said constitution of government.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor385" id="FNanchor385"></a><a href="#Footnote-385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>Such, then, was the real question over which in
that assemblage, from the first day to the last, the
battle raged. The result of the battle was reached
on Wednesday, the 25th of June; and that result
was a victory for immediate adoption, but by a
majority of only ten votes, instead of the fifty votes
that were claimed for it at the beginning of the
session. Moreover, even that small majority for
immediate adoption was obtained only by the help,
first, of a preamble solemnly affirming it to be the
understanding of Virginia in this act that it retained
every power not expressly granted to the
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
general government; and, secondly, of a subsidiary
resolution promising to recommend to Congress
&#8220;whatsoever amendments may be deemed
necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just before the decisive question was put, Patrick
Henry, knowing that the result would be
against him, and knowing, also, from the angry
things uttered within that House and outside of it,
that much solicitude was abroad respecting the
course likely to be taken by the defeated party,
then and there spoke these noble words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;I beg pardon of this House for having taken up more
time than came to my share, and I thank them for the
patience and polite attention with which I have been
heard. If I shall be in the minority, I shall have those
painful sensations which arise from a conviction of
being overpowered in a good cause. Yet I will be a
peaceable citizen. My head, my hand, and my heart
shall be at liberty to retrieve the loss of liberty, and remove
the defects of that system in a constitutional way.
I wish not to go to violence, but will wait, with hopes
that the spirit which predominated in the Revolution is
not yet gone, nor the cause of those who are attached to
the Revolution yet lost. I shall therefore patiently wait
in expectation of seeing that government changed, so as
to be compatible with the safety, liberty, and happiness
of the people.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor386" id="FNanchor386"></a><a href="#Footnote-386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p></div>

<p>Those words of the great Virginian leader proved
to be a message of reassurance to many an anxious
citizen, in many a State,&mdash;not least so to that
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
great citizen who, from the slopes of Mount Vernon,
was then watching, night and day, for signs
of some abatement in the storm of civil discord.
Those words, too, have, in our time, won for the
orator who spoke them the deliberate, and the
almost lyrical, applause of the greatest historian
who has yet laid hand on the story of the Constitution:
&#8220;Henry showed his genial nature, free from
all malignity. He was like a billow of the ocean
on the first bright day after the storm, dashing
itself against the rocky cliff, and then, sparkling
with light, retreating to its home.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor387" id="FNanchor387"></a><a href="#Footnote-387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>Long after the practical effects of the Virginia
convention of 1788 had been merged in the general
political life of the country, that convention
was still proudly remembered for the magnificent
exertions of intellectual power, and particularly of
eloquence, which it had called forth. So lately as
the year 1857, there was still living a man who, in
his youth, had often looked in upon that famous
convention, and whose enthusiasm, in recalling its
great scenes, was not to be chilled even by the
frosts of his ninety winters:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The impressions made by the powerful arguments
of Madison and the overwhelming eloquence of Henry
can never fade from my mind. I thought them almost
supernatural. They seemed raised up by Providence,
each in his way, to produce great results: the one by
his grave, dignified, and irresistible arguments to convince
and enlighten mankind; the other, by his brilliant
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
and enrapturing eloquence to lead whithersoever he
would.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor388" id="FNanchor388"></a><a href="#Footnote-388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p></div>

<p>Those who had heard Patrick Henry on the other
great occasions of his career were ready to say
that his eloquence in the convention of 1788 was,
upon the whole, fully equal to anything ever exhibited
by him in any other place. The official reports
of his speeches in that assemblage were always declared
to be inferior in &#8220;strength and beauty&#8221; to
those actually made by him there.<a name="FNanchor389" id="FNanchor389"></a><a href="#Footnote-389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>
&#8220;In forming
an estimate of his eloquence,&#8221; says one gentleman
who there heard him, &#8220;no reliance can be placed
on the printed speeches. No reporter whatever
could take down what he actually said; and if he
could, it would fall far short of the original.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor390" id="FNanchor390"></a><a href="#Footnote-390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p>In his arguments against the Constitution Patrick
Henry confined himself to no systematic order.
The convention had indeed resolved that the document
should be discussed, clause by clause, in a
regular manner; but in spite of the complaints
and reproaches of his antagonists, he continually
broke over all barriers, and delivered his &#8220;multiform
and protean attacks&#8221; in such order as suited
the workings of his own mind.</p>

<p>In the course of that long and eager controversy,
he had several passages of sharp personal collision
with his opponents, particularly with Governor
Randolph, whose vacillating course respecting the
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
Constitution had left him exposed to the most
galling comments, and who on one occasion, in his
anguish, turned upon Patrick Henry with the exclamation:
&#8220;I find myself attacked in the most
illiberal manner by the honorable gentleman. I
disdain his aspersions and his insinuations. His
asperity is warranted by no principle of parliamentary
decency, nor compatible with the least
shadow of friendship; and if our friendship must
fall, let it fall, like Lucifer, never to rise again.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor391" id="FNanchor391"></a><a href="#Footnote-391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>
Like all very eloquent men, he was taunted, of
course, for having more eloquence than logic; for
&#8220;his declamatory talents;&#8221; for his &#8220;vague discourses
and mere sports of fancy;&#8221; for discarding
&#8220;solid argument;&#8221; and for &#8220;throwing those bolts&#8221;
which he had &#8220;so peculiar a dexterity at discharging.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor392" id="FNanchor392"></a><a href="#Footnote-392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>
On one occasion, old General Adam Stephen
tried to burlesque the orator&#8217;s manner of
speech;<a name="FNanchor393" id="FNanchor393"></a><a href="#Footnote-393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> on another occasion, that same petulant
warrior bluntly told Patrick that if he did &#8220;not
like this government,&#8221; he might &#8220;go and live
among the Indians,&#8221; and even offered to facilitate
the orator&#8217;s self-expatriation among the savages:
&#8220;I know of several nations that live very happily;
and I can furnish him with a vocabulary of their
language.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor394" id="FNanchor394"></a><a href="#Footnote-394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>Knowing, as he did, every passion and prejudice
of his audience, he adopted, it appears, almost
every conceivable method of appeal. &#8220;The variety
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
of arguments,&#8221; writes one witness, &#8220;which
Mr. Henry generally presented in his speeches,
addressed to the capacities, prejudices, and individual
interests of his hearers, made his speeches
very unequal. He rarely made in that convention
a speech which Quintilian would have approved.
If he soared at times, like the eagle, and seemed
like the bird of Jove to be armed with thunder, he
did not disdain to stoop like the hawk to seize his
prey,&mdash;but the instant that he had done it, rose
in pursuit of another quarry.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor395" id="FNanchor395"></a><a href="#Footnote-395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the most wonderful example of his eloquence,
if we may judge by contemporary descriptions,
was that connected with the famous scene of
the thunder-storm, on Tuesday, the 24th of June,
only one day before the decisive vote was taken.
The orator, it seems, had gathered up all his forces
for what might prove to be his last appeal against
immediate adoption, and was portraying the disasters
which the new system of government, unless
amended, was to bring upon his countrymen, and
upon all mankind: &#8220;I see the awful immensity of
the dangers with which it is pregnant. I see it.
I feel it. I see beings of a higher order anxious
concerning our decision. When I see beyond the
horizon that bounds human eyes, and look at the
final consummation of all human things, and see
those intelligent beings which inhabit the ethereal
mansions reviewing the political decisions and
revolutions which, in the progress of time, will
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
happen in America, and the consequent happiness
or misery of mankind, I am led to believe that
much of the account, on one side or the other, will
depend on what we now decide. Our own happiness
alone is not affected by the event. All
nations are interested in the determination. We
have it in our power to secure the happiness of one
half of the human race. Its adoption may involve
the misery of the other hemisphere.&#8221; Thus far
the stenographer had proceeded, when he suddenly
stopped, and placed within brackets the following
note: &#8220;[Here a violent storm arose, which put
the House in such disorder, that Mr. Henry was
obliged to conclude.]&#8221;<a name="FNanchor396" id="FNanchor396"></a><a href="#Footnote-396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>
But the scene which is
thus quietly despatched by the official reporter of
the convention was again and again described, by
many who were witnesses of it, as something most
sublime and even appalling. After having delineated
with overpowering vividness the calamities
which were likely to befall mankind from their
adoption of the proposed frame of government,
the orator, it is said, as if wielding an enchanter&#8217;s
wand, suddenly enlarged the arena of the debate
and the number of his auditors; for, peering
beyond the veil which shuts in mortal sight, and
pointing &#8220;to those celestial beings who were hovering
over the scene,&#8221; he addressed to them &#8220;an
invocation that made every nerve shudder with
supernatural horror, when, lo! a storm at that
instant rose, which shook the whole building, and
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
the spirits whom he had called seemed to have
come at his bidding. Nor did his eloquence, or
the storm, immediately cease; but availing himself
of the incident, with a master&#8217;s art, he seemed to
mix in the fight of his ethereal auxiliaries, and,
&#8216;rising on the wings of the tempest, to seize upon
the artillery of heaven, and direct its fiercest thunders
against the heads of his adversaries.&#8217; The
scene became insupportable; and the House rose
without the formality of adjournment, the members
rushing from their seats with precipitation
and confusion.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor397" id="FNanchor397"></a><a href="#Footnote-397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX <br />
<span class="hsub">THE AFTER-FIGHT FOR AMENDMENTS</span></h2>


<p>Thus, on the question of adopting the new Constitution,
the fight was over; but on the question
of amending that Constitution, now that it had
been adopted, the fight, of course, was only just
begun.</p>

<p>For how could this new Constitution be amended?
A way was provided,&mdash;but an extremely strait
and narrow way. No amendment whatsoever could
become valid until it had been accepted by three
fourths of the States; and no amendment could be
submitted to the States for their consideration
until it had first been approved, either by two
thirds of both houses of Congress, or else by a
majority of a convention specially called by Congress
at the request of two thirds of the States.</p>

<p>Clearly, the framers of the Constitution intended
that the supreme law of the land, when once agreed
to, should have within it a principle of fixedness
almost invincible. At any rate, the process by
which alone alterations can be made, involves so
wide an area of territory, so many distinct groups
of population, and is withal, in itself, so manifold
and complex, so slow, and so liable to entire stoppage,<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
that any proposition looking toward change
must inevitably perish long before reaching the
far-away goal of final endorsement, unless that proposition
be really impelled by a public demand not
only very energetic and persistent, but well-nigh
universal. Indeed, the constitutional provision for
amendments seemed, at that time, to many, to be
almost a constitutional prohibition of amendments.</p>

<p>It was, in part, for this very reason that Patrick
Henry had urged that those amendments of the
Constitution which, in his opinion, were absolutely
necessary, should be secured before its adoption,
and not be left to the doubtful chance of their being
obtained afterward, as the result of a process
ingeniously contrived, as it were, to prevent their
being obtained at all. But at the close of that
June day on which he and his seventy-eight associates
walked away from the convention wherein,
on this very proposition, they had just been voted
down, how did the case stand? The Constitution,
now become the supreme law of the land, was a
Constitution which, unless amended, would, as they
sincerely believed, effect the political ruin of the
American people. As good citizens, as good men,
what was left for them to do? They had fought
hard to get the Constitution amended before adoption.
They had failed. They must now fight hard
to get it amended after adoption. Disastrous
would it be, to assume that the needed amendments
would now be carried at any rate. True,
the Virginia convention, like the conventions of
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
several other States, had voted to recommend
amendments. But the hostility to amendments,
as Patrick Henry believed, was too deeply rooted
to yield to mere recommendations. The necessary
amendments would not find their way through all
the hoppers and tubes and valves of the enormous
mill erected within the Constitution, unless forced
onward by popular agitation,&mdash;and by popular
agitation widespread, determined, vehement, even
alarming. The powerful enemies of amendments
must be convinced that, until amendments were
carried through that mill, there would be no true
peace or content among the surrounding inhabitants.</p>

<p>This gives us the clew to the policy steadily and
firmly pursued by Patrick Henry as a party leader,
from June, 1788, until after the ratification of the
first ten amendments, on the 15th of December,
1791. It was simply a strategic policy dictated
by his honest view of the situation; a bold, manly,
patriotic policy; a policy, however, which was
greatly misunderstood, and grossly misrepresented,
at the time; a policy, too, which grieved the heart
of Washington, and for several years raised between
him and his ancient friend the one cloud of
distrust that ever cast a shadow upon their intercourse.</p>

<p>In fact, at the very opening of the Virginia
convention, and in view of the possible defeat of
his demand for amendments, Patrick Henry had
formed a clear outline of this policy, even to the
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
extent of organizing throughout the State local
societies for stirring up, and for keeping up, the
needed agitation. All this is made evident by an
important letter written by him to General John
Lamb of New York, and dated at Richmond,
June 9, 1788,&mdash;when the convention had been in
session just one week. In this letter, after some
preliminary words, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is matter of great consolation to find that the sentiments
of a vast majority of Virginians are in unison
with those of our Northern friends. I am satisfied four
fifths of our inhabitants are opposed to the new scheme
of government. Indeed, in the part of this country
lying south of James River, I am confident, nine tenths
are opposed to it. And yet, strange as it may seem, the
numbers in convention appear equal on both sides: so
that the majority, which way soever it goes, will be small.
The friends and seekers of power have, with their usual
subtilty, wriggled themselves into the choice of the
people, by assuming shapes as various as the faces of
the men they address on such occasions.</p>

<p>If they shall carry their point, and preclude previous
amendments, which we have ready to offer, it will become
highly necessary to form the society you mention.
Indeed, it appears the only chance for securing a remnant
of those invaluable rights which are yielded by the
new plan. Colonel George Mason has agreed to act
as chairman of our republican society. His character I
need not describe. He is every way fit; and we have
concluded to send you by Colonel Oswald a copy of the
Bill of Rights, and of the particular amendments we
intend to propose in our convention. The fate of them
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
is altogether uncertain; but of that you will be informed.
To assimilate our views on this great subject
is of the last moment; and our opponents expect much
from our dissension. As we see the danger, I think it
is easily avoided.</p>

<p>I can assure you that North Carolina is more decidedly
opposed to the new government than Virginia.
The people there seem rife for hazarding all, before
they submit. Perhaps the organization of our system
may be so contrived as to include lesser associations
dispersed throughout the State. This will remedy in
some degree the inconvenience arising from our dispersed
situation. Colonel Oswald&#8217;s short stay here prevents
my saying as much on the subject as I could
otherwise have done. And after assuring you of my
ardent wishes for the happiness of our common country,
and the best interests of humanity, I beg leave to subscribe
myself, with great respect and regard,</p>

<p class="right1">
Sir, your obedient, humble servant,<br />
<span class="smcap">P. Henry.</span><a name="FNanchor398" id="FNanchor398"></a><a href="#Footnote-398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>
</p></div>

<p>On the 27th of June, within a few hours, very
likely, after the final adjournment of the convention,
Madison hastened to report to Washington
the great and exhilarating result, but with this
anxious and really unjust surmise respecting the
course then to be pursued by Patrick Henry:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;y declared, previous to the final question,
that although he should submit as a quiet citizen,
he should seize the first moment that offered for shaking
off the yoke in a constitutional way. I suspect the
plan will be to encourage two thirds of the legislatures
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
in the task of undoing the work; or to get a Congress
appointed in the first instance that will commit suicide
on their own authority.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor399" id="FNanchor399"></a><a href="#Footnote-399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p></div>

<p>At the same sitting, probably, Madison sent off
to Hamilton, at New York, another report, in
which his conjecture as to Patrick Henry&#8217;s intended
policy is thus stated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;I am so uncharitable as to suspect that the ill-will
to the Constitution will produce every peaceable effort
to disgrace and destroy it. Mr. Henry declared &hellip;
that he should wait with impatience for the favorable
moment of regaining, in a constitutional way, the lost
liberties of his country.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor400" id="FNanchor400"></a><a href="#Footnote-400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p></div>

<p>Two days afterward, by which time, doubtless,
Madison&#8217;s letter had reached Mount Vernon,
Washington wrote to Benjamin Lincoln of Massachusetts,
respecting the result of the convention:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Our accounts from Richmond are that &hellip; the
final decision exhibited a solemn scene, and that there
is every reason to expect a perfect acquiescence therein
by the minority. Mr. Henry, the great leader of it, has
signified that, though he can never be reconciled to the
Constitution in its present form, and shall give it every
constitutional opposition in his power, yet he will submit
to it peaceably.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor401" id="FNanchor401"></a><a href="#Footnote-401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p></div>

<p>Thus, about the end of June, 1788, there came
down upon the fierce political strife in Virginia a
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
lull, which lasted until the 20th of October, at
which time the legislature assembled for its autumnal
session. Meantime, however, the convention of
New York had adopted the Constitution, but after
a most bitter fight, and by a majority of only three
votes, and only in consequence of the pledge that
every possible effort should be made to obtain
speedily those great amendments that were at last
called for by a determined public demand. One
of the efforts contemplated by the New York convention
took the form of a circular letter to the
governors of the several States, urging almost pathetically
that &#8220;effectual measures be immediately
taken for calling a convention&#8221; to propose those
amendments which are necessary for allaying &#8220;the
apprehensions and discontents&#8221; then so prevalent.<a name="FNanchor402" id="FNanchor402"></a><a href="#Footnote-402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p>This circular letter &#8220;rekindled,&#8221; as Madison
then wrote to Jefferson, &#8220;an ardor among the opponents
of the federal Constitution for an immediate
revision of it by another general convention,
&hellip; Mr. Henry and his friends in Virginia enter
with great zeal into the scheme.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor403" id="FNanchor403"></a><a href="#Footnote-403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> In a letter
written by Washington, nearly a month before the
meeting of the legislature, it is plainly indicated
that his mind was then grievously burdened by the
anxieties of the situation, and that he was disposed
to put the very worst construction upon the expected
conduct of Patrick Henry and his party in
the approaching session:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>

<p>&#8220;Their expedient will now probably be an attempt to
procure the election of so many of their own junto under
the new government, as, by the introduction of local and
embarrassing disputes, to impede or frustrate its operation.&hellip;
I assure you I am under painful apprehensions
from the single circumstance of Mr. H. having the
whole game to play in the Assembly of this State; and
the effect it may have in others should be counteracted
if possible.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor404" id="FNanchor404"></a><a href="#Footnote-404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p></div>

<p>No sooner had the Assembly met, than Patrick
Henry&#8217;s ascendency became apparent. His sway
over that body was such that it was described as
&#8220;omnipotent.&#8221; And by the time the session had
been in progress not quite a month, Washington
informed Madison that &#8220;the accounts from Richmond&#8221;
were &#8220;very unpropitious to federal measures.&#8221;
&#8220;In one word,&#8221; he added, &#8220;it is said that
the edicts of Mr. H. are enregistered with less opposition
in the Virginia Assembly than those of the
grand monarch by his parliaments. He has only
to say, Let this be law, and it is law.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor405" id="FNanchor405"></a><a href="#Footnote-405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> Within
ten days from the opening of the session, the House
showed its sensitive response to Patrick Henry&#8217;s
leadership by adopting a series of resolutions, the
chief purpose of which was to ask Congress to call
immediately a national convention for proposing
to the States the required amendments. In the
debate on the subject, he is said to have declared
&#8220;that he should oppose every measure tending to
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
the organization of the government, unless accompanied
with measures for the amendment of the
Constitution.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor406" id="FNanchor406"></a><a href="#Footnote-406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>Some phrases in one of his resolutions were most
offensive to those members of the House who had
&#8220;befriended the new Constitution,&#8221; and who, by
implication at least, were held forth as &#8220;betrayers
of the dearest rights of the people.&#8221; &#8220;If Mr.
Henry pleases,&#8221; so wrote a correspondent of Washington,
&#8220;he will carry the resolution in its present
terms, than which none, in my opinion, can be more
exceptionable or inflammatory; though, as he is
sometimes kind and condescending, he may perhaps
be induced to alter it.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor407" id="FNanchor407"></a><a href="#Footnote-407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>

<p>In accordance with these resolutions, a formal
application to Congress for a national convention
was prepared by Patrick Henry, and adopted by
the House on the 14th of November. Every word
of that document deserves now to be read, as his
own account of the spirit and purpose of a measure
then and since then so profoundly and so
cruelly misinterpreted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The good people of this commonwealth, in convention
assembled, having ratified the Constitution submitted
to their consideration, this legislature has, in
conformity to that act, and the resolutions of the United
States in Congress assembled to them transmitted,
thought proper to make the arrangements that were
<i>necessary</i> for carrying it into effect. Having thus shown
themselves obedient to the voice of their constituents, all
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
America will find that, so far as it depends on them,
that plan of government will be carried into immediate
operation.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the sense of the people of Virginia would be
but in part complied with, and but little regarded, if
we went no further. In the very moment of adoption,
and coeval with the ratification of the new plan of
government, the general voice of the convention of
this State pointed to objects no less interesting to the
people we represent, and equally entitled to your attention.
At the same time that, from motives of affection
for our sister States, the convention yielded their assent
to the ratification, they gave the most unequivocal
proofs that they dreaded its operation under the present
form.</p>

<p>&#8220;In acceding to a government under this impression,
painful must have been the prospect, had they not derived
consolation from a full expectation of its imperfections
being speedily amended. In this resource, therefore,
they placed their confidence,&mdash;a confidence that
will continue to support them whilst they have reason to
believe they have not calculated upon it in vain.</p>

<p>&#8220;In making known to you the objections of the people
of this Commonwealth to the new plan of government,
we deem it unnecessary to enter into a particular
detail of its defects, which they consider as involving all
the great and unalienable rights of freemen: for their
sense on this subject, we refer you to the proceedings
of their late convention, and the sense of this General
Assembly, as expressed in their resolutions of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day
of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>

<p>&#8220;We think proper, however, to declare that in our
opinion, as those objections were not founded in speculative
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
theory, but deduced from principles which have been
established by the melancholy example of other nations,
in different ages, so they will never be removed until the
cause itself shall cease to exist. The sooner, therefore,
the public apprehensions are quieted, and the government
is possessed of the confidence of the people, the
more salutary will be its operations, and the longer its
duration.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cause of amendments we consider as a common
cause; and since concessions have been made from political
motives, which we conceive may endanger the
republic, we trust that a commendable zeal will be shown
for obtaining those provisions which, experience has
taught us, are necessary to secure from danger the unalienable
rights of human nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;The anxiety with which our countrymen press for
the accomplishment of this important end, will ill admit
of delay. The slow forms of congressional discussion
and recommendation, if indeed they should ever agree
to any change, would, we fear, be less certain of success.
Happily for their wishes, the Constitution hath presented
an alternative, by admitting the submission to a convention
of the States. To this, therefore, we resort, as the
source from whence they are to derive relief from their
present apprehensions. We do, therefore, in behalf of
our constituents, in the most earnest and solemn manner,
make this application to Congress, that a convention be
immediately called, of deputies from the several States,
with full power to take into their consideration the
defects of this Constitution, that have been suggested
by the state conventions, and report such amendments
thereto, as they shall find best suited to promote our
common interests, and secure to ourselves and our latest
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
posterity the great and unalienable rights of mankind.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor408" id="FNanchor408"></a><a href="#Footnote-408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p></div>

<p>Such was the purpose, such was the temper,
of Virginia&#8217;s appeal, addressed to Congress, and
written by Patrick Henry, on behalf of immediate
measures for curing the supposed defects of the
Constitution. Was it not likely that this appeal
would be granted? One grave doubt haunted the
mind of Patrick Henry. If, in the elections for
senators and representatives then about to occur
in the several States, very great care was not taken,
it might easily happen that a majority of the members
of Congress would be composed of men who
would obstruct, and perhaps entirely defeat, the
desired amendments. With the view of doing his
part towards the prevention of such a result, he
determined that both the senators from Virginia,
and as many as possible of its representatives,
should be persons who could be trusted to help,
and not to hinder, the great project.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when the day came for the election
of senators by the Assembly of Virginia, he just
stood up in his place and named &#8220;Richard Henry
Lee and William Grayson, Esquires,&#8221; as the two
men who ought to be elected as senators; and,
furthermore, he named James Madison as the
one man who ought not to be elected as senator.
Whereupon the vote was taken; &#8220;and after some
time,&#8221; as the journal expresses it, the committee
to examine the ballot-boxes &#8220;returned into the
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
House, and reported that they had &hellip; found a
majority of votes in favor of Richard Henry Lee
and William Grayson, Esquires.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor409" id="FNanchor409"></a><a href="#Footnote-409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> On the 8th of
December, 1788, just one month afterward, Madison
himself, in a letter to Jefferson, thus alluded
to the incident: &#8220;They made me a candidate for
the Senate, for which I had not allotted my pretensions.
The attempt was defeated by Mr. Henry,
who is omnipotent in the present legislature, and
who added to the expedients common on such
occasions a public philippic against my federal
principles.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor410" id="FNanchor410"></a><a href="#Footnote-410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>Virginia&#8217;s delegation in the Senate was thus
made secure. How about her delegation in the
lower house? That, also, was an affair to be
sharply looked to. Above all things, James Madison,
as the supposed foe of amendments, was to be
prevented, if possible, from winning an election.
Therefore the committee of the House of Delegates,
which was appointed for the very purpose, among
other things, of dividing the State into its ten congressional
districts, so carved out those districts as
to promote the election of the friends of the good
cause, and especially to secure, as was hoped, the
defeat of its great enemy. Of this committee Patrick
Henry was not a member; but as a majority
of its members were known to be his devoted followers,
very naturally upon him, at the time, was
laid the burden of the blame for practising this
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
ignoble device in politics,&mdash;a device which, when
introduced into Massachusetts several years afterward,
also by a Revolutionary father, came to be
christened with the satiric name of &#8220;gerrymandering.&#8221;
Surely it was a rare bit of luck, in the case
of Patrick Henry, that the wits of Virginia did not
anticipate the wits of Massachusetts by describing
this trick as &#8220;henrymandering;&#8221; and that he thus
narrowly escaped the ugly immortality of having
his name handed down from age to age in the
coinage of a base word which should designate a
base thing,&mdash;one of the favorite, shabby man&#339;uvres
of less scrupulous American politicians.<a name="FNanchor411" id="FNanchor411"></a><a href="#Footnote-411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p>Thus, however, within four weeks from the opening
of the session, he had succeeded in pressing
through the legislature, in the exact form he
wished, all these measures for giving effect to
Virginia&#8217;s demand upon Congress for amendments.
This being accomplished, he withdrew from the
service of the House for the remainder of the session,
probably on account of the great urgency of
his professional engagements at that time. The
journal of the House affords us no trace of his
presence there after the 18th of November; and
although the legislature continued in session until
the 13th of December, its business did not digress
beyond local topics. To all these facts, rather
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
bitter allusion is made in a letter to the governor
of New Hampshire, written from Mount Vernon,
on the 31st of January, 1789, by the private secretary
of Washington, Tobias Lear, who thus reflected,
no doubt, the mood of his chief:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Mr. Henry, the leader of the opposition in this State,
finding himself beaten off the ground by fair argument
in the state convention, and outnumbered upon the
important question, collected his whole strength, and
pointed his whole force against the government, in the
Assembly. He here met with but a feeble opposition.&hellip;
He led on his almost unresisted phalanx, and
planted the standard of hostility upon the very battlements
of federalism. In plain English, he ruled a majority
of the Assembly; and his edicts were registered
by that body with less opposition than those of the
Grand Monarque have met with from his parliaments.
He chose the two senators.&hellip; He divided the State
into districts, &hellip; taking care to arrange matters so as
to have the county, of which Mr. Madison is an inhabitant,
thrown into a district of which a majority were
supposed to be unfriendly to the government, and by
that means exclude him from the representative body in
Congress. He wrote the answer to Governor Clinton&#8217;s
letter, and likewise the circular letter to the executives
of the several States.&hellip; And after he had settled
everything relative to the government wholly, I suppose,
to his satisfaction, he mounted his horse and rode home,
leaving the little business of the State to be done by
anybody who chose to give themselves the trouble of
attending to it.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor412" id="FNanchor412"></a><a href="#Footnote-412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
How great was the effect of these strategic measures,
forced by Patrick Henry through the legislature
of Virginia in the autumn of 1788, was not
apparent, of course, until after the organization of
the first Congress of the United States, in the
spring of 1789. Not until the 5th of May could
time be found by that body for paying the least
attention to the subject of amendments. On that
day Theodoric Bland, from Virginia, presented to
the House of Representatives the solemn application
of his State for a new convention; and, after
some discussion, this document was entered on the
journals of the House.<a name="FNanchor413" id="FNanchor413"></a><a href="#Footnote-413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> The subject was then
dropped until the 8th of June, when Madison, who
had been elected to Congress in spite of Patrick
Henry, and who had good reason to know how
dangerous it would be for Congress to trifle with
the popular demand for amendments, succeeded,
against much opposition, in getting the House to
devote that day to a preliminary discussion of the
business. It was again laid aside for nearly six
weeks, and again got a slight hearing on the 21st
of July. On the 13th of August it was once more
brought to the reluctant attention of the House,
and then proved the occasion of a debate which
lasted until the 24th of that month, when the
House finished its work on the subject, and sent
up to the Senate seventeen articles of amendment.
Only twelve of these articles succeeded in passing
the Senate; and of these twelve, only ten received
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
from the States that approval which was necessary
to their ratification. This was obtained on the 15th
of December, 1791.</p>

<p>The course thus taken by Congress, in itself proposing
amendments, was not at the time pleasing to
the chiefs of that party which, in the several States,
had been clamorous for amendments.<a name="FNanchor414" id="FNanchor414"></a><a href="#Footnote-414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> These men,
desiring more radical changes in the Constitution
than could be expected from Congress, had set
their hearts on a new convention,&mdash;which, undoubtedly,
had it been called, would have reconstructed,
from top to bottom, the work done by the
convention of 1787. Yet it should be noticed that
the ten amendments, thus obtained under the initiative
of Congress, embodied &#8220;nearly every material
change suggested by Virginia;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor415" id="FNanchor415"></a><a href="#Footnote-415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> and that it
was distinctly due, in no small degree, to the bitter
and implacable urgency of the popular feeling in
Virginia, under the stimulus of Patrick Henry&#8217;s
leadership, that Congress was induced by Madison
to pay any attention to the subject. In the matter
of amendments, therefore, Patrick Henry and his
party did not get all that they demanded, nor in
the way that they demanded; but even so much as
they did get, they would not then have got at all,
had they not demanded more, and demanded more,
also, through the channel of a new convention, the
dread of which, it is evident, drove Madison and
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
his brethren in Congress into the prompt concession
of amendments which they themselves did not
care for. Those amendments were really a tub to
the whale; but then that tub would not have been
thrown overboard at all, had not the whale been
there, and very angry, and altogether too troublesome
with his foam-compelling tail, and with that
huge head of his which could batter as well as
spout.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX <br />
<span class="hsub">LAST LABORS AT THE BAR</span></h2>


<p>The incidents embraced within the last three
chapters cover the period from 1786 to 1791, and
have been thus narrated by themselves for the purpose
of exhibiting as distinctly as possible, and in
unbroken sequence, Patrick Henry&#8217;s relations to
each succeeding phase of that immense national
movement which produced the American Constitution,
with its first ten amendments.</p>

<p>During those same fervid years, however, in
which he was devoting, as it might seem, every
power of body and mind to his great labors as a
party leader, and as a critic and moulder of the
new Constitution, he had resumed, and he was
sturdily carrying forward, most exacting labors in
the practice of the law.</p>

<p>Late in the year 1786, as will be remembered,
being then poor and in debt, he declined another
election to the governorship, and set himself to the
task of repairing his private fortunes, so sadly
fallen to decay under the noble neglect imposed by
his long service of the public. One of his kinsmen
has left on record a pleasant anecdote to the
effect that the orator happened to mention at that
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
time to a friend how anxious he was under the
great burden of his debts. &#8220;Go back to the bar,&#8221;
said his friend; &#8220;your tongue will soon pay your
debts. If you will promise to go, I will give you a
retaining fee on the spot.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor416" id="FNanchor416"></a><a href="#Footnote-416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> This course, in fact,
he had already determined to take; and thus at the
age of fifty, at no time robust in health, and at that
time grown prematurely old under the storm and
stress of all those unquiet years, he again buckled
on his professional armor, rusty from long disuse,
and pluckily began his life over again, in the hope
of making some provision for his own declining
days, as well as for the honor and welfare of his
great brood of children and grandchildren. To
this task, accordingly, he then bent himself, with
a grim wilfulness that would not yield either to
bodily weakness, or to the attractions or the distractions
of politics. It is delightful to be permitted
to add, that his energy was abundantly
rewarded; and that in exactly eight years thereafter,
namely in 1794, he was able to retire, in comfort
and wealth, from all public and professional
employments of every sort.</p>

<p>Of course the mere announcement, in 1786, that
Patrick Henry was then ready once more to receive
clients, was enough to excite the attention of
all persons in Virginia who might have important
interests in litigation. His great renown throughout
the country, his high personal character, his
overwhelming gifts in argument, his incomparable
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
gifts in persuasion, were such as to ensure an
almost dominant advantage to any cause which he
should espouse before any tribunal. Confining
himself, therefore, to his function as an advocate,
and taking only such cases as were worth his attention,
he was immediately called to appear in the
courts in all parts of the State.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for us to try to follow this
veteran and brilliant advocate in his triumphal
progress from one court-house to another, or to
give the detail of the innumerable causes in which
he was engaged during these last eight years of
his practice at the bar. Of all the causes, however,
in which he ever took part as a lawyer, in
any period of his career, probably the most difficult
and important, in a legal aspect, was the one
commonly referred to as that of the British debts,
argued by him in the Circuit Court of the United
States at Richmond, first in 1791, and again, in
the same place, in 1793.<a name="FNanchor417" id="FNanchor417"></a><a href="#Footnote-417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<p>A glance at the origin of this famous cause will
help us the better to understand the significance
of his relation to it. By the treaty with Great
Britain in 1783, British subjects were empowered
&#8220;to recover debts previously contracted to them
by our citizens, notwithstanding a payment of the
debt into a state treasury had been made during
the war, under the authority of a state law of
sequestration.&#8221; According to this provision a
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
British subject, one William Jones, brought an
action of debt in the federal court at Richmond,
against a citizen of Virginia, Thomas Walker, on
a bond dated May, 1772. The real question was
&#8220;whether payment of a debt due before the war
of the Revolution, from a citizen of Virginia to
British subjects, into the loan office of Virginia,
pursuant to a law of that State, discharged the
debtor.&#8221;</p>

<p>The case, as will readily be seen, involved many
subtle and difficult points of law, municipal, national,
and international; and the defence was
contained in the following five pleas: (1.) That
of payment, generally; (2.) That of the Virginia
act of sequestration, October 20, 1777; (3.) That
of the Virginia act of forfeiture, May 3, 1779;
(4.) That of British violations of the treaty of
1783; (5.) That of the necessary annulment of
the debt, in consequence of the dissolution of the
co-allegiance of the two parties, on the declaration
of independence.<a name="FNanchor418" id="FNanchor418"></a><a href="#Footnote-418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p>Some idea of the importance attached to the
case may be inferred from the assertion of Wirt,
that &#8220;the whole power of the bar of Virginia was
embarked&#8221; in it; and that the &#8220;learning, argument,
and eloquence&#8221; exhibited in the discussion
were such &#8220;as to have placed that bar, in the estimation
of the federal judges, &hellip; above all others
in the United States.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor419" id="FNanchor419"></a><a href="#Footnote-419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> Associated with Patrick
Henry, for the defendant, were John Marshall,
Alexander Campbell, and James Innes.</p>

<p><span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
For several weeks before the trial of this cause
in 1791, Patrick Henry secluded himself from all
other engagements, and settled down to intense
study in the retirement of his home in the country.
A grandson of the orator, Patrick Henry
Fontaine, who was there as a student of the law,
relates that he himself was sent off on a journey
of sixty miles to procure a copy of Vattel&#8217;s Law
of Nations. From this and other works of international
law, the old lawyer &#8220;made many quotations;
and with the whole syllabus of notes and
heads of arguments, he filled a manuscript volume
more than an inch thick, and closely written; a
book &hellip; bound with leather, and convenient for
carrying in his pocket. He had in his yard &hellip;
an office, built at some distance from his dwelling,
and an avenue of fine black locusts shaded a walk
in front of it.&hellip; He usually walked and meditated,
when the weather permitted, in this shaded
avenue.&hellip; For several days in succession, before
his departure to Richmond to attend the
court,&#8221; the orator was seen &#8220;walking frequently
in this avenue, with his note-book in his hand,
which he often opened and read; and from his
gestures, while promenading alone in the shade of
the locusts,&#8221; it was supposed that he was committing
his speech to memory.<a name="FNanchor420" id="FNanchor420"></a><a href="#Footnote-420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> According to another
account, so eager was his application to this labor
that, in one stage of it, &#8220;he shut himself up in
his office for three days, during which he did not
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
see his family; his food was handed by a servant
through the office door.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor421" id="FNanchor421"></a><a href="#Footnote-421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> Of all this preparation,
not unworthy to be called Demosthenic, the result
was, if we may accept the opinion of one eminent
lawyer, that Patrick Henry &#8220;came forth, on this
occasion, a perfect master of every law, national
and municipal, which touched the subject of investigation
in the most distant point.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor422" id="FNanchor422"></a><a href="#Footnote-422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>It was on the 14th of November, 1791, that the
cause came on to be argued in the court-house at
Richmond, before Judges Johnson and Blair of
the Supreme Court, and Judge Griffin of that district.
The case of the plaintiff was opened by Mr.
Counsellor Baker, whose argument lasted till the
evening of that day. Patrick Henry was to begin
his argument in reply the next morning.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The legislature was then in session; but when
eleven o&#8217;clock, the hour for the meeting of the court,
arrived, the speaker found himself without a house to
do business. All his authority and that of his sergeant
at arms were unavailing to keep the members in their
seats: every consideration of public duty yielded to the
anxiety which they felt, in common with the rest of
their fellow citizens, to hear this great man on this truly
great and extensively interesting question. Accordingly,
when the court was ready to proceed to business, the
court-room of the capitol, large as it is, was insufficient
to contain the vast concourse that was pressing to enter
it. The portico, and the area in which the statue of
Washington stands, were filled with a disappointed
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
crowd, who nevertheless maintained their stand without.
In the court-room itself, the judges, through condescension
to the public anxiety, relaxed the rigor of respect
which they were in the habit of exacting, and permitted
the vacant seats of the bench, and even the windows
behind it, to be occupied by the impatient multitude.
The noise and tumult occasioned by seeking a more favorable
station was at length hushed, and the profound
silence which reigned within the room gave notice to
those without that the orator had risen, or was on the
point of rising. Every eye in front of the bar was
riveted upon him with the most eager attention; and
so still and deep was the silence that every one might
hear the throbbing of his own heart. Mr. Henry, however,
appeared wholly unconscious that all this preparation
was on his account, and rose with as much simplicity
and composure as if the occasion had been one
of ordinary occurrence.&hellip; It may give the reader
some idea of the amplitude of the argument, when he
is told that Mr. Henry was engaged three days successively
in its delivery; and some faint conception of the
enchantment which he threw over it, when he learns
that although it turned entirely on questions of law, yet
the audience, mixed as it was, seemed so far from being
wearied, that they followed him throughout with increased
enjoyment. The room continued full to the
last; and such was &#8216;the listening silence&#8217; with which he
was heard, that not a syllable that he uttered is believed
to have been lost. When he finally sat down, the concourse
rose, with a general murmur of admiration; the
scene resembled the breaking up and dispersion of a
great theatrical assembly, which had been enjoying, for
the first time, the exhibition of some new and splendid
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
drama; the speaker of the House of Delegates was at
length able to command a quorum for business; and
every quarter of the city, and at length every part of
the State, was filled with the echoes of Mr. Henry&#8217;s
eloquent speech.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor423" id="FNanchor423"></a><a href="#Footnote-423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p></div>

<p>In the spring of 1793 this cause was argued a
second time, before the same district judge, and, in
addition, before Mr. Chief Justice Jay, and Mr.
Justice Iredell of the Supreme Court. On this
occasion, apparently, there was the same eagerness
to hear Patrick Henry as before,&mdash;an eagerness
which was shared in by the two visiting judges, as
is indicated in part by a letter from Judge Iredell,
who, on the 27th of May, thus wrote to his wife:
&#8220;We began on the great British causes the second
day of the court, and are now in the midst of them.
The great Patrick Henry is to speak to-day.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor424" id="FNanchor424"></a><a href="#Footnote-424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>
Among the throng of people who then poured into
the court-room was John Randolph of Roanoke,
then a stripling of twenty years, who, having got a
position very close to the judges, was made aware
of their conversation with one another as the case
proceeded. He describes the orator as not expecting
to speak at that time; &#8220;as old, very much
wrapped up, and resting his head on the bar.&#8221;
Meanwhile the chief justice, who, in earlier days,
had often heard Henry in the Continental Congress,
told Iredell that that feeble old gentleman
in mufflers, with his head bowed wearily down
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
upon the bar, was &#8220;the greatest of orators.&#8221; &#8220;Iredell
doubted it; and, becoming impatient to hear
him, they requested him to proceed with his argument,
before he had intended to speak.&hellip; As he
arose, he began to complain that it was a hardship,
too great, to put the laboring oar into the hands
of a decrepit old man, trembling, with one foot in
the grave, weak in his best days, and far inferior
to the able associate by him.&#8221; Randolph then
gives an outline of his progress through the earlier
and somewhat tentative stages of his speech, comparing
his movement to the exercise &#8220;of a first-rate,
four-mile race-horse, sometimes displaying his
whole power and speed for a few leaps, and then
taking up again.&#8221; &#8220;At last,&#8221; according to Randolph,
the orator &#8220;got up to full speed; and took
a rapid view of what England had done, when she
had been successful in arms; and what would
have been our fate, had we been unsuccessful. The
color began to come and go in the face of the chief
justice; while Iredell sat with his mouth and eyes
stretched open, in perfect wonder. Finally, Henry
arrived at his utmost height and grandeur. He
raised his hands in one of his grand and solemn
pauses.&hellip; There was a tumultuous burst of applause;
and Judge Iredell exclaimed, &#8216;Gracious
God! he is an orator indeed!&#8217;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor425" id="FNanchor425"></a><a href="#Footnote-425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> It is said, also,
by another witness, that Henry happened that day
to wear on his finger a diamond ring; and that
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
in the midst of the supreme splendor of his eloquence,
a distinguished English visitor who had
been given a seat on the bench, said with significant
emphasis to one of the judges, &#8220;The diamond
is blazing!&#8221;<a name="FNanchor426" id="FNanchor426"></a><a href="#Footnote-426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p>As examples of forensic eloquence, on a great
subject, before a great and a fit assemblage, his
several speeches in the case of the British debts
were, according to all the testimony, of the highest
order of merit. What they were as examples of
legal learning and of legal argumentation, may be
left for every lawyer to judge for himself, by reading,
if he so pleases, the copious extracts which
have been preserved from the stenographic reports
of these speeches, as taken by Robertson. Even
from that point of view, they appear not to have
suffered by comparison with the efforts made, in
that cause, on the same side, by John Marshall
himself. No inconsiderable portion of his auditors
were members of the bar; and those keen and
competent critics are said to have acknowledged
themselves as impressed &#8220;not less by the matter
than the manner&#8221; of his speeches.<a name="FNanchor427" id="FNanchor427"></a><a href="#Footnote-427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> Moreover,
though not expressly mentioned, Patrick Henry&#8217;s
argument is pointedly referred to in the high compliment
pronounced by Judge Iredell, when giving
his opinion in this case:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The cause has been spoken to, at the bar, with a
degree of ability equal to any occasion.&hellip; I shall, as
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
long as I live, remember with pleasure and respect the
arguments which I have heard in this case. They have
discovered an ingenuity, a depth of investigation, and a
power of reasoning fully equal to anything I have ever
witnessed; and some of them have been adorned with a
splendor of eloquence surpassing what I have ever felt
before. Fatigue has given way under its influence, and
the heart has been warmed, while the understanding has
been instructed.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor428" id="FNanchor428"></a><a href="#Footnote-428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p></div>

<p>It will be readily understood, however, that
while Patrick Henry&#8217;s practice included important
causes turning, like the one just described, on propositions
of law, and argued by him before the
highest tribunals, the larger part of the practice
to be had in Virginia at that time must have been
in actions tried before juries, in which his success
was chiefly due to his amazing endowments of
sympathy, imagination, tact, and eloquence. The
testimony of contemporary witnesses respecting
his power in this direction is most abundant, and
also most interesting; and, for obvious reasons,
such portions of it as are now to be reproduced
should be given in the very language of the persons
who thus heard him, criticised him, and made
deliberate report concerning him.</p>

<p>First of all, in the way of preliminary analysis
of Henry&#8217;s genius and methods as an advocate before
juries, may be cited a few sentences of Wirt,
who, indeed, never heard him, but who, being himself
a very gifted and a very ambitious advocate,<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
eagerly collected and keenly scanned the accounts
of many who had heard him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;He adapted himself, without effort, to the character
of the cause; seized with the quickness of intuition its
defensible point, and never permitted the jury to lose
sight of it. Sir Joshua Reynolds has said of Titian,
that, by a few strokes of his pencil, he knew how to
mark the image and character of whatever object he
attempted; and produced by this means a truer representation
than any of his predecessors, who finished
every hair. In like manner Mr. Henry, by a few
master-strokes upon the evidence, could in general
stamp upon the cause whatever image or character he
pleased; and convert it into tragedy or comedy, at his
sovereign will, and with a power which no efforts of his
adversary could counteract. He never wearied the jury
by a dry and minute analysis of the evidence; he did
not expend his strength in finishing the hairs; he produced
all his high effect by those rare master-touches,
and by the resistless skill with which, in a very few
words, he could mould and color the prominent facts of
a cause to his purpose. He had wonderful address, too,
in leading off the minds of his hearers from the contemplation
of unfavorable points, if at any time they were
too stubborn to yield to his power of transformation.&hellip;
It required a mind of uncommon vigilance, and
most intractable temper, to resist this charm with which
he decoyed away his hearers; it demanded a rapidity
of penetration, which is rarely, if ever, to be found in
the jury-box, to detect the intellectual juggle by which
he spread his nets around them; it called for a stubbornness
and obduracy of soul which does not exist, to
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
sit unmoved under the pictures of horror or of pity
which started from his canvas. They might resolve, if
they pleased, to decide the cause against him, and to
disregard everything which he could urge in the defence
of his client. But it was all in vain. Some feint
in an unexpected direction threw them off their guard,
and they were gone; some happy phrase, burning from
the soul; some image fresh from nature&#8217;s mint, and
bearing her own beautiful and genuine impress, struck
them with delightful surprise, and melted them into
conciliation; and conciliation towards Mr. Henry was
victory inevitable. In short, he understood the human
character so perfectly; knew so well all its strength and
all its weaknesses, together with every path and by-way
which winds around the citadel of the best fortified
heart and mind, that he never failed to take them,
either by stratagem or storm.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor429" id="FNanchor429"></a><a href="#Footnote-429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p></div>

<p>Still further, in the way of critical analysis,
should be cited the opinion of a distinguished
student and master of eloquence, the Rev. Archibald
Alexander of Princeton, who, having more
than once heard Patrick Henry, wrote out, with a
scholar&#8217;s precision, the results of his own keen
study into the great advocate&#8217;s success in subduing
men, and especially jurymen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The power of Henry&#8217;s eloquence was due, first, to
the greatness of his emotion and passion, accompanied
with a versatility which enabled him to assume at once
any emotion or passion which was suited to his ends.
Not less indispensable, secondly, was a matchless perfection
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
of the organs of expression, including the entire
apparatus of voice, intonation, pause, gesture, attitude,
and indescribable play of countenance. In no instance
did he ever indulge in an expression that was not instantly
recognized as nature itself; yet some of his penetrating
and subduing tones were absolutely peculiar, and
as inimitable as they were indescribable. These were
felt by every hearer, in all their force. His mightiest
feelings were sometimes indicated and communicated
by a long pause, aided by an eloquent aspect, and some
significant use of his finger. The sympathy between
mind and mind is inexplicable. Where the channels of
communication are open, the faculty of revealing inward
passion great, and the expression of it sudden and visible,
the effects are extraordinary. Let these shocks of
influence be repeated again and again, and all other
opinions and ideas are for the moment absorbed or excluded;
the whole mind is brought into unison with that
of the speaker; and the spell-bound listener, till the
cause ceases, is under an entire fascination. Then perhaps
the charm ceases, upon reflection, and the infatuated
hearer resumes his ordinary state.</p>

<p>&#8220;Patrick Henry, of course, owed much to his singular
insight into the feelings of the common mind. In
great cases he scanned his jury, and formed his mental
estimate; on this basis he founded his appeals to their
predilections and character. It is what other advocates
do, in a lesser degree. When he knew that there were
conscientious or religious men among the jury, he would
most solemnly address himself to their sense of right,
and would adroitly bring in scriptural citations. If this
handle was not offered, he would lay bare the sensibility
of patriotism. Thus it was, when he succeeded in rescuing
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
the man who had deliberately shot down a neighbor;
who moreover lay under the odious suspicion of being a
Tory, and who was proved to have refused supplies to a
brigade of the American army.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor430" id="FNanchor430"></a><a href="#Footnote-430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p></div>

<p>Passing now from these general descriptions to
particular instances, we may properly request Dr.
Alexander to remain somewhat longer in the witness-stand,
and to give us, in detail, some of his
own recollections of Patrick Henry. His testimony,
accordingly, is in these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;From my earliest childhood I had been accustomed
to hear of the eloquence of Patrick Henry. On this
subject there existed but one opinion in the country.
The power of his eloquence was felt equally by the
learned and the unlearned. No man who ever heard
him speak, on any important occasion, could fail to admit
his uncommon power over the minds of his hearers.&hellip;
Being then a young man, just entering on a profession
in which good speaking was very important, it
was natural for me to observe the oratory of celebrated
men. I was anxious to ascertain the true secret of their
power; or what it was which enabled them to sway the
minds of hearers, almost at their will.</p>

<p>&#8220;In executing a mission from the synod of Virginia,
in the year 1794, I had to pass through the county
of Prince Edward, where Mr. Henry then resided.
Understanding that he was to appear before the circuit
court, which met in that county, in defence of three
men charged with murder, I determined to seize the
opportunity of observing for myself the eloquence of
this extraordinary orator. It was with some difficulty
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
I obtained a seat in front of the bar, where I could
have a full view of the speaker, as well as hear him
distinctly. But I had to submit to a severe penance in
gratifying my curiosity; for the whole day was occupied
with the examination of witnesses, in which Mr.
Henry was aided by two other lawyers. In person,
Mr. Henry was lean rather than fleshy. He was rather
above than below the common height, but had a stoop
in the shoulders which prevented him from appearing
as tall as he really was. In his moments of animation,
he had the habit of straightening his frame, and adding
to his apparent stature. He wore a brown wig, which
exhibited no indication of any great care in the dressing.
Over his shoulders he wore a brown camlet cloak.
Under this his clothing was black, something the worse
for wear. The expression of his countenance was that
of solemnity and deep earnestness. His mind appeared
to be always absorbed in what, for the time, occupied
his attention. His forehead was high and spacious, and
the skin of his face more than usually wrinkled for a
man of fifty. His eyes were small and deeply set in
his head, but were of a bright blue color, and twinkled
much in their sockets. In short, Mr. Henry&#8217;s appearance
had nothing very remarkable, as he sat at rest.
You might readily have taken him for a common
planter, who cared very little about his personal appearance.
In his manners he was uniformly respectful and
courteous. Candles were brought into the court-house,
when the examination of the witnesses closed; and the
judges put it to the option of the bar whether they
would go on with the argument that night or adjourn
until the next day. Paul Carrington, Junior, the attorney
for the State, a man of large size, and uncommon
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
dignity of person and manner, and also an accomplished
lawyer, professed his willingness to proceed immediately,
while the testimony was fresh in the minds of all.
Now for the first time I heard Mr. Henry make anything
of a speech; and though it was short, it satisfied
me of one thing, which I had particularly desired to
have decided: namely, whether like a player he merely
assumed the appearance of feeling. His manner of addressing
the court was profoundly respectful. He would
be willing to proceed with the trial, &#8216;but,&#8217; said he, &#8216;my
heart is so oppressed with the weight of responsibility
which rests upon me, having the lives of three fellow
citizens depending, probably, on the exertions which I
may be able to make in their behalf (here he turned
to the prisoners behind him), that I do not feel able
to proceed to-night. I hope the court will indulge me,
and postpone the trial till the morning.&#8217; The impression
made by these few words was such as I assure
myself no one can ever conceive by seeing them in
print. In the countenance, action, and intonation of the
speaker, there was expressed such an intensity of feeling,
that all my doubts were dispelled; never again
did I question whether Henry felt, or only acted a
feeling. Indeed, I experienced an instantaneous sympathy
with him in the emotions which he expressed;
and I have no doubt the same sympathy was felt by
every hearer.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a matter of course, the proceedings were deferred
till the next morning. I was early at my post;
the judges were soon on the bench, and the prisoners at
the bar. Mr. Carrington &hellip; opened with a clear and
dignified speech, and presented the evidence to the jury.
Everything seemed perfectly plain. Two brothers and
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
a brother-in-law met two other persons in pursuit of a
slave, supposed to be harbored by the brothers. After
some altercation and mutual abuse, one of the brothers,
whose name was John Ford, raised a loaded gun which
he was carrying, and presenting it at the breast of one
of the other pair, shot him dead, in open day. There
was no doubt about the fact. Indeed, it was not denied.
There had been no other provocation than opprobrious
words. It is presumed that the opinion of every juror
was made up from merely hearing the testimony; as
Tom Harvey, the principal witness, who was acting as
constable on the occasion, appeared to be a respectable
man. For the clearer understanding of what follows, it
must be observed that said constable, in order to distinguish
him from another of the name, was commonly
called Butterwood Harvey, as he lived on Butterwood
Creek. Mr. Henry, it is believed, understanding that
the people were on their guard against his faculty of
moving the passions and through them influencing the
judgment, did not resort to the pathetic as much as was
his usual practice in criminal cases. His main object
appeared to be, throughout, to cast discredit on the testimony
of Tom Harvey. This he attempted by causing
the law respecting riots to be read by one of his assistants.
It appeared in evidence that Tom Harvey had
taken upon him to act as constable, without being in
commission; and that with a posse of men he had entered
the house of one of the Fords in search of the
negro, and had put Mrs. Ford, in her husband&#8217;s absence,
into a great terror, while she was in a very delicate
condition, near the time of her confinement. As
he descanted on the evidence, he would often turn to
Tom Harvey&mdash;a large, bold-looking man&mdash;and with
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
the most sarcastic look would call him by some name
of contempt; &#8216;this Butterwood Tom Harvey,&#8217; &#8216;this
would-be constable,&#8217; etc. By such expressions, his contempt
for the man was communicated to the hearers.
I own I felt it gaining on me, in spite of my better
judgment; so that before he was done, the impression
was strong on my mind that Butterwood Harvey was
undeserving of the smallest credit. This impression,
however, I found I could counteract the moment I had
time for reflection. The only part of the speech in
which he manifested his power of touching the feelings
strongly, was where he dwelt on the irruption of the
company into Ford&#8217;s house, in circumstances so perilous
to the solitary wife. This appeal to the sensibility of
husbands&mdash;and he knew that all the jury stood in this
relation&mdash;was overwhelming. If the verdict could
have been rendered immediately after this burst of the
pathetic, every man, at least every husband, in the
house, would have been for rejecting Harvey&#8217;s testimony,
if not for hanging him forthwith.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor431" id="FNanchor431"></a><a href="#Footnote-431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p></div>

<p>A very critical and cool-headed witness respecting
Patrick Henry&#8217;s powers as an advocate was Judge
Spencer Roane, who presided in one of the courts
in which the orator was much engaged after his
return to the bar in 1786:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;When I saw him there,&#8221; writes Judge Roane, &#8220;he
must necessarily have been very rusty; yet I considered
him as a good lawyer.&hellip; It was as a criminal lawyer
that his eloquence had the finest scope.&hellip; He was a
perfect master of the passions of his auditory, whether
in the tragic or the comic line. The tones of his voice,
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
to say nothing of his matter and gesture, were insinuated
into the feelings of his hearers, in a manner that
baffled all description. It seemed to operate by mere
sympathy, and by his tones alone it seemed to me that
he could make you cry or laugh at pleasure. Yet his
gesture came powerfully in aid, and, if necessary, would
approach almost to the ridiculous.&hellip; I will try to
give some account of his tragic and comic effect in two
instances that came before me. About the year 1792,
one Holland killed a young man in Botetourt.&hellip;
Holland had gone up from Louisa as a schoolmaster,
but had turned out badly, and was very unpopular. The
killing was in the night, and was generally believed to
be murder.&hellip; At the instance of the father and for a
reasonable fee, Mr. H. undertook to go to Greenbrier
court to defend Holland. Mr. Winston and myself were
the judges. Such were the prejudices there, as I was
afterwards informed by Thomas Madison, that the people
there declared that even Patrick Henry need not
come to defend Holland, unless he brought a jury with
him. On the day of the trial the court-house was
crowded, and I did not move from my seat for fourteen
hours, and had no wish to do so. The examination took
up a great part of the time, and the lawyers were probably
exhausted. Breckenridge was eloquent, but Henry
left no dry eye in the court-house. The case, I believe,
was murder, though, possibly, manslaughter only; and
Henry laid hold of this possibility with such effect as to
make all forget that Holland had killed the storekeeper,
and presented the deplorable case of the jury&#8217;s killing
Holland, an innocent man. He also presented, as it
were, at the clerk&#8217;s table, old Holland and his wife, who
were then in Louisa, and asked what must be the feeling
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
of this venerable pair at this awful moment, and
what the consequences to them of a mistaken verdict
affecting the life of their son. He caused the jury to
lose sight of the murder they were then trying, and weep
with old Holland and his wife, whom he painted, and
perhaps proved to be, very respectable. All this was
done in a manner so solemn and touching, and a tone so
irresistible, that it was impossible for the stoutest heart
not to take sides with the criminal.&hellip; The result of
the trial was, that, after a retirement of an half or
quarter of an hour, the jury brought in a verdict of not
guilty! But on being reminded by the court that they
might find an inferior degree of homicide, they brought
in a verdict of manslaughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Henry was equally successful in the comic line.&hellip;
The case was that a wagoner and the plaintiff were
travelling to Richmond, and the wagoner knocked down
a turkey and put it into his wagon. Complaint was
made to the defendant, a justice; both the parties were
taken up; and the wagoner agreed to take a whipping
rather than be sent to jail. But the plaintiff refused.
The justice, however, gave him, also, a small whipping;
and for this the suit was brought. The plaintiff&#8217;s plea
was that he was wholly innocent of the act committed.
Mr. H., on the contrary, contended that he was a party
aiding and assisting. In the course of his remarks he
thus expressed himself: &#8216;But, gentlemen of the jury,
this plaintiff tells you that he had nothing to do with the
turkey. I dare say, gentlemen,&mdash;not until it was
roasted!&#8217; and he pronounced the word&mdash;&#8216;roasted&#8217;&mdash;with
such rotundity of voice, and comicalness of manner
and gesture, that it threw every one into a fit of laughter
at the plaintiff, who stood up in the place usually
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
allotted to the criminals; and the defendant was let off
with little or no damages.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor432" id="FNanchor432"></a><a href="#Footnote-432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p></div>

<p>Finally, we must recall, in illustration of our
present subject, an anecdote left on record in 1813,
by the Rev. Conrad Speece, highly distinguished
during his lifetime, in the Presbyterian communion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Many years ago,&#8221; he then wrote, &#8220;I was at the
trial, in one of our district courts, of a man charged with
murder. The case was briefly this: the prisoner had
gone, in execution of his office as a constable, to arrest
a slave who had been guilty of some misconduct, and
bring him to justice. Expecting opposition in the business,
the constable took several men with him, some of
them armed. They found the slave on the plantation of
his master, within view of the house, and proceeded to
seize and bind him. His mistress, seeing the arrest,
came down and remonstrated vehemently against it.
Finding her efforts unavailing, she went off to a barn
where her husband was, who was presently perceived
running briskly to the house. It was known he always
kept a loaded rifle over his door. The constable now
desired his company to remain where they were, taking
care to keep the slave in custody, while he himself would
go to the house to prevent mischief. He accordingly
ran towards the house. When he arrived within a short
distance of it, the master appeared coming out of the
door with his rifle in his hand. Some witnesses said
that as he came to the door he drew the cock of the
piece, and was seen in the act of raising it to the position
of firing. But upon these points there was not an
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
entire agreement in the evidence. The constable, standing
near a small building in the yard, at this instant
fired, and the fire had a fatal effect. No previous malice
was proved against him; and his plea upon the trial
was, that he had taken the life of his assailant in necessary
self-defence.</p>

<p>&#8220;A great mass of testimony was delivered. This was
commented upon with considerable ability by the lawyer
for the commonwealth, and by another lawyer engaged
by the friends of the deceased for the prosecution. The
prisoner was also defended, in elaborate speeches, by
two respectable advocates. These proceedings brought
the day to a close. The general whisper through a
crowded house was, that the man was guilty and could
not be saved.</p>

<p>&#8220;About dusk, candles were brought, and Henry arose.
His manner was &hellip; plain, simple, and entirely unassuming.
&#8216;Gentlemen of the jury,&#8217; said he, &#8216;I dare say
we are all very much fatigued with this tedious trial.
The prisoner at the bar has been well defended already;
but it is my duty to offer you some further observations
in behalf of this unfortunate man. I shall aim at brevity.
But should I take up more of your time than you
expect, I hope you will hear me with patience, when
you consider that blood is concerned.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot admit the possibility that any one, who
never heard Henry speak, should be made fully to conceive
the force of impression which he gave to these few
words, &#8216;blood is concerned.&#8217; I had been on my feet
through the day, pushed about in the crowd, and was
excessively weary. I was strongly of opinion, too, notwithstanding
all the previous defensive pleadings, that
the prisoner was guilty of murder; and I felt anxious
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
to know how the matter would terminate. Yet when
Henry had uttered these words, my feelings underwent
an instantaneous change. I found everything within me
answering,&mdash;&#8216;Yes, since blood is concerned, in the name
of all that is righteous, go on; we will hear you with
patience until the rising of to-morrow&#8217;s sun!&#8217; This
bowing of the soul must have been universal; for the
profoundest silence reigned, as if our very breath had
been suspended. The spell of the magician was upon
us, and we stood like statues around him. Under the
touch of his genius, every particular of the story assumed
a new aspect, and his cause became continually more
bright and promising. At length he arrived at the fatal
act itself: &#8216;You have been told, gentlemen, that the
prisoner was bound by every obligation to avoid the
supposed necessity of firing, by leaping behind a house
near which he stood at that moment. Had he been
attacked with a club, or with stones, the argument would
have been unanswerable, and I should feel myself compelled
to give up the defence in despair. But surely
I need not tell you, gentlemen, how wide is the difference
between sticks or stones, and double-triggered, loaded
rifles cocked at your breast!&#8217; The effect of this terrific
image, exhibited in this great orator&#8217;s peerless manner,
cannot be described. I dare not attempt to delineate
the paroxysm of emotion which it excited in every heart.
The result of the whole was, that the prisoner was acquitted;
with the perfect approbation, I believe, of the
numerous assembly who attended the trial. What was
it that gave such transcendent force to the eloquence of
Henry? His reasoning powers were good; but they
have been equalled, and more than equalled, by those
of many other men. His imagination was exceedingly
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
quick, and commanded all the stores of nature, as
materials for illustrating his subject. His voice and
delivery were inexpressibly happy. But his most irresistible
charm was the vivid feeling of his cause, with
which he spoke. Such feeling infallibly communicates
itself to the breast of the hearer.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor433" id="FNanchor433"></a><a href="#Footnote-433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI <br />
<span class="hsub">IN RETIREMENT</span></h2>


<p>In the year 1794, being then fifty-eight years
old, and possessed at last of a competent fortune,
Patrick Henry withdrew from his profession, and
resolved to spend in retirement the years that
should remain to him on earth. Removing from
Prince Edward County, he lived for a short time
at Long Island, in Campbell County; but in 1795
he finally established himself in the county of
Charlotte, on an estate called Red Hill,&mdash;an estate
which continued to be his home during the rest of
his life, which gave to him his burial place, and
which still remains in the possession of his descendants.</p>

<p>The rapidity with which he had thus risen out of
pecuniary embarrassments was not due alone to the
earnings of his profession during those few years;
for while his eminence as an advocate commanded
the highest fees, probably, that were then paid in
Virginia, it is apparent from his account-books that
those fees were not at all exorbitant, and for a
lawyer of his standing would not now be regarded
as even considerable. The truth is that, subsequently
to his youthful and futile attempts at business,<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
he had so profited by the experiences of his
life as to have become a sagacious and an expert
man of business. &#8220;He could buy or sell a horse,
or a negro, as well as anybody, and was peculiarly
a judge of the value and quality of lands.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor434" id="FNanchor434"></a><a href="#Footnote-434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> It
seems to have been chiefly from his investments in
lands, made by him with foresight and judgment,
and from which, for a long time, he had reaped
only burdens and anxieties, that he derived the
wealth that secured for him the repose of his last
years. The charge long afterward made by Jefferson,
that Patrick Henry&#8217;s fortune came either from
a mean use of his right to pay his land debts in a
depreciated currency &#8220;not worth oak-leaves,&#8221; or
from any connection on his part with the profligate
and infamous Yazoo speculation, has been shown,
by ample evidence, to be untrue.<a name="FNanchor435" id="FNanchor435"></a><a href="#Footnote-435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

<p>The descriptions which have come down to us of
the life led by the old statesman in those last five
years of retirement make a picture pleasant to look
upon. The house at Red Hill, which then became
his home, &#8220;is beautifully situated on an elevated
ridge, the dividing line of Campbell and Charlotte,
within a quarter of a mile of the junction of Falling
River with the Staunton. From it the valley of the
Staunton stretches southward about three miles,
varying from a quarter to nearly a mile in width,
and of an oval-like form. Through most fertile
meadows waving in their golden luxuriance, slowly
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
winds the river, overhung by mossy foliage, while
on all sides gently sloping hills, rich in verdure,
enclose the whole, and impart to it an air of seclusion
and repose. From the brow of the hill, west
of the house, is a scene of an entirely different
character: the Blue Ridge, with the lofty peaks of
Otter, appears in the horizon at a distance of nearly
sixty miles.&#8221; Under the trees which shaded his
lawn, and &#8220;in full view of the beautiful valley
beneath, the orator was accustomed, in pleasant
weather, to sit mornings and evenings, with his
chair leaning against one of their trunks, and
a can of cool spring-water by his side, from
which he took frequent draughts. Occasionally,
he walked to and fro in the yard from one clump
of trees to the other, buried in revery, at which
times he was never interrupted.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor436" id="FNanchor436"></a><a href="#Footnote-436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>
&#8220;His great delight,&#8221;
says one of his sons-in-law, &#8220;was in conversation,
in the society of his friends and family,
and in the resources of his own mind.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor437" id="FNanchor437"></a><a href="#Footnote-437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> Thus
beneath his own roof, or under the shadow of his
own trees, he loved to sit, like a patriarch, with
his family and his guests gathered affectionately
around him, and there, free from ceremony as from
care, to give himself up to the interchange of congenial
thought whether grave or playful, and even
to the sports of the children. &#8220;His visitors,&#8221; writes
one of them, &#8220;have not unfrequently caught him
lying on the floor, with a group of these little ones
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
climbing over him in every direction, or dancing
around him with obstreperous mirth, to the tune
of his violin, while the only contest seemed to be
who should make the most noise.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor438" id="FNanchor438"></a><a href="#Footnote-438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>The evidence of contemporaries respecting the
sweetness of his spirit and his great lovableness in
private life is most abundant. One who knew him
well in his family, and who was also quite willing
to be critical upon occasion, has said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;With respect to the domestic character of Mr.
Henry, nothing could be more amiable. In every relation,
as a husband, father, master, and neighbor, he
was entirely exemplary. As to the disposition of Mr.
Henry, it was the best imaginable. I am positive that
I never saw him in a passion, nor apparently even out
of temper. Circumstances which would have highly
irritated other men had no such visible effect on him.
He was always calm and collected; and the rude attacks
of his adversaries in debate only whetted the poignancy
of his satire.&hellip; Shortly after the Constitution was
adopted, a series of the most abusive and scurrilous
pieces came out against him, under the signature of
Decius. They were supposed to be written by John
Nicholas, &hellip; with the assistance of other more important
men. They assailed Mr. Henry&#8217;s conduct in
the Convention, and slandered his character by various
stories hatched up against him. These pieces were extremely
hateful to all Mr. Henry&#8217;s friends, and, indeed,
to a great portion of the community. I was at his
house in Prince Edward during the thickest of them.&hellip;
He evinced no feeling on the occasion, and far less
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
condescended to parry the effects on the public mind.
It was too puny a contest for him, and he reposed upon
the consciousness of his own integrity.&hellip; With many
sublime virtues, he had no vice that I knew or ever
heard of, and scarcely a foible. I have thought, indeed,
that he was too much attached to property,&mdash;a defect,
however, which might be excused when we reflect on
the largeness of a beloved family, and the straitened
circumstances in which he had been confined during a
great part of his life.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor439" id="FNanchor439"></a><a href="#Footnote-439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p></div>

<p>Concerning his personal habits, we have, through
his grandson, Patrick Henry Fontaine, some testimony
which has the merit of placing the great
man somewhat more familiarly before us. &#8220;He
was,&#8221; we are told, &#8220;very abstemious in his diet,
and used no wine or alcoholic stimulants. Distressed
and alarmed at the increase of drunkenness
after the Revolutionary war, he did everything
in his power to arrest the vice. He thought
that the introduction of a harmless beverage, as a
substitute for distilled spirits, would be beneficial.
To effect this object, he ordered from his merchant
in Scotland a consignment of barley, and a Scotch
brewer and his wife to cultivate the grain, and
make small beer. To render the beverage fashionable
and popular, he always had it upon his table
while he was governor during his last term of
office; and he continued its use, but drank nothing
stronger, while he lived.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor440" id="FNanchor440"></a><a href="#Footnote-440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p>Though he was always a most loyal Virginian,<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
he became, particularly in his later years, very unfriendly
to that renowned and consolatory herb so
long associated with the fame and fortune of his
native State.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;In his old age, the condition of his nervous system
made the scent of a tobacco-pipe very disagreeable to
him. The old colored house-servants were compelled
to hide their pipes, and rid themselves of the scent of
tobacco, before they ventured to approach him.&hellip;
They protested that they had not smoked, or seen a
pipe; and he invariably proved the culprit guilty by following
the scent, and leading them to the corn-cob pipes
hid in some crack or cranny, which he made them take
and throw instantly into the kitchen fire, without reforming
their habits, or correcting the evil, which is likely to
continue as long as tobacco will grow.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor441" id="FNanchor441"></a><a href="#Footnote-441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p></div>

<p>Concerning another of his personal habits, during
the years thus passed in retirement at Red
Hill, there is a charming description, also derived
from the grandson to whom we are indebted for the
facts just mentioned:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;His residence overlooked a large field in the bottom
of Staunton River, the most of which could be seen from
his yard. He rose early; and in the mornings of the
spring, summer, and fall, before sunrise, while the air
was cool and calm, reflecting clearly and distinctly the
sounds of the lowing herds and singing birds, he stood
upon an eminence, and gave orders and directions to his
servants at work a half mile distant from him. The
strong, musical voices of the negroes responded to him.<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
During this elocutionary morning exercise, his enunciation
was clear and distinct enough to be heard over an
area which ten thousand people could not have filled;
and the tones of his voice were as melodious as the notes
of an Alpine horn.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor442" id="FNanchor442"></a><a href="#Footnote-442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p></div>

<p>Of course the house-servants and the field-servants
just mentioned were slaves; and, from the beginning
to the end of his life, Patrick Henry was
a slaveholder. He bought slaves, he sold slaves,
and, along with the other property&mdash;the lands, the
houses, the cattle&mdash;bequeathed by him to his heirs,
were numerous human beings of the African race.
What, then, was the opinion respecting slavery
held by this great champion of the rights of man?
&#8220;Is it not amazing&#8221;&mdash;thus he wrote in 1773&mdash;&#8220;that,
at a time when the rights of humanity are
defined and understood with precision, in a country
above all others fond of liberty, in such an age, we
find men, professing a religion the most humane,
mild, meek, gentle, and generous, adopting a principle
as repugnant to humanity as it is inconsistent
with the Bible and destructive to liberty?&hellip;
Would any one believe that I am master of slaves
of my own purchase? I am drawn along by the
general inconvenience of living without them. I
will not, I cannot, justify it; however culpable my
conduct, I will so far pay my &#8216;devoir&#8217; to virtue as
to own the excellence and rectitude of her precepts,
and to lament my want of conformity to them. I
believe a time will come when an opportunity will
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
be offered to abolish this lamentable evil: everything
we can do is to improve it, if it happens in
our day; if not, let us transmit to our descendants,
together with our slaves, a pity for their unhappy
lot, and an abhorrence of slavery. We owe to the
purity of our religion, to show that it is at variance
with that law which warrants slavery.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor443" id="FNanchor443"></a><a href="#Footnote-443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> After the
Revolution, and before the adoption of the Constitution,
he earnestly advocated, in the Virginia House
of Delegates, some method of emancipation; and
even in the Convention of 1788, where he argued
against the Constitution on the ground that it
obviously conferred upon the general government,
in an emergency, that power of emancipation which,
in his opinion, should be retained by the States,
he still avowed his hostility to slavery, and at the
same time his inability to see any practicable means
of ending it: &#8220;Slavery is detested: we feel its
fatal effects,&mdash;we deplore it with all the pity of
humanity.&hellip; As we ought with gratitude to admire
that decree of Heaven which has numbered
us among the free, we ought to lament and deplore
the necessity of holding our fellow-men in bondage.
But is it practicable, by any human means, to liberate
them without producing the most dreadful
and ruinous consequences?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor444" id="FNanchor444"></a><a href="#Footnote-444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<p>During all the years of his retirement, his great
fame drew to him many strangers, who came to
pay their homage to him, to look upon his face, to
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
listen to his words. Such guests were always received
by him with a cordiality that was unmistakable,
and so modest and simple as to put them at
once at their ease. Of course they desired most of
all to hear him talk of his own past life, and of the
great events in which he had borne so brilliant a
part; but whenever he was persuaded to do so, it
was always with the most quiet references to himself.
&#8220;No man,&#8221; says one who knew him well,
&#8220;ever vaunted less of his achievements than Mr.
H. I hardly ever heard him speak of those great
achievements which form the prominent part of his
biography. As for boasting, he was entirely a
stranger to it, unless it be that, in his latter days,
he seemed proud of the goodness of his lands, and,
I believe, wished to be thought wealthy. It is my
opinion that he was better pleased to be flattered
as to his wealth than as to his great talents. This
I have accounted for by recollecting that he had
long been under narrow and difficult circumstances
as to property, from which he was at length happily
relieved; whereas there never was a time when his
talents had not always been conspicuous, though he
always seemed unconscious of them.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor445" id="FNanchor445"></a><a href="#Footnote-445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<p>It should not be supposed that, in his final withdrawal
from public and professional labors, he
surrendered himself to the enjoyment of domestic
happiness, without any positive occupation of the
mind. From one of his grandsons, who was much
with him in those days, the tradition is derived
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
that, besides &#8220;setting a good example of honesty,
benevolence, hospitality, and every social virtue,&#8221;
he assisted &#8220;in the education of his younger children,&#8221;
and especially devoted much time &#8220;to earnest
efforts to establish true Christianity in our
country.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor446" id="FNanchor446"></a><a href="#Footnote-446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> He gave himself more than ever to the
study of the Bible, as well as of two or three of
the great English divines, particularly Tillotson,
Butler, and Sherlock. The sermons of the latter,
he declared, had removed &#8220;all his doubts of the
truth of Christianity;&#8221; and from a volume which
contained them, and which was full of his pencilled
notes, he was accustomed to read &#8220;every Sunday
evening to his family; after which they all joined
in sacred music, while he accompanied them on the
violin.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor447" id="FNanchor447"></a><a href="#Footnote-447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

<p>There seems to have been no time in his life,
after his arrival at manhood, when Patrick Henry
was not regarded by his private acquaintances as
a positively religious person. Moreover, while he
was most tolerant of all forms of religion, and was
on peculiarly friendly terms with their ministers, to
whose preaching he often listened, it is inaccurate
to say, as Wirt has done, that, though he was a
Christian, he was so &#8220;after a form of his own;&#8221;
that &#8220;he was never attached to any particular religious
society, and never &hellip; communed with any
church.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor448" id="FNanchor448"></a><a href="#Footnote-448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> On the contrary, from a grandson who
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
spent many years in his household comes the tradition
that &#8220;his parents were members of the Protestant
Episcopal Church, of which his uncle, Patrick
Henry, was a minister;&#8221; that &#8220;he was baptized
and made a member of it in early life;&#8221; and that
&#8220;he lived and died an exemplary member of it.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor449" id="FNanchor449"></a><a href="#Footnote-449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>
Furthermore, in 1830, the Rev. Charles Dresser,
rector of Antrim Parish, Halifax County, Virginia,
wrote that the widow of Patrick Henry told
him that her husband used to receive &#8220;the communion
as often as an opportunity was offered, and
on such occasions always fasted until after he had
communicated, and spent the day in the greatest
retirement. This he did both while governor and
afterward.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor450" id="FNanchor450"></a><a href="#Footnote-450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> In a letter to one of his daughters,
written in 1796, he makes this touching confession:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Amongst other strange things said of me, I hear it
is said by the deists that I am one of the number; and,
indeed, that some good people think I am no Christian.
This thought gives me much more pain than the appellation
of Tory; because I think religion of infinitely
higher importance than politics; and I find much cause
to reproach myself that I have lived so long, and
have given no decided and public proofs of my being a
Christian. But, indeed, my dear child, this is a character
which I prize far above all this world has, or can
boast.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor451" id="FNanchor451"></a><a href="#Footnote-451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>
</p>
</div>


<p><span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
While he thus spoke, humbly and sorrowfully,
of his religious position as a thing so little known
to the public that it could be entirely misunderstood
by a portion of them, it is plain that no
one who had seen him in the privacy of his life at
home could have had any misunderstanding upon
that subject. For years before his retirement from
the law, it had been his custom, we are told, to
spend &#8220;one hour every day &hellip; in private devotion.
His hour of prayer was the close of the
day, including sunset; &hellip; and during that sacred
hour, none of his family intruded upon his privacy.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor452" id="FNanchor452"></a><a href="#Footnote-452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>As regards his religious faith, Patrick Henry,
while never ostentatious of it, was always ready
to avow it, and to defend it. The French alliance
during our Revolution, and our close intercourse
with France immediately afterward, hastened
among us the introduction of certain French
writers who were assailants of Christianity, and
who soon set up among the younger and perhaps
brighter men of the country the fashion of casting
off, as parts of an outworn and pitiful superstition,
the religious ideas of their childhood, and even the
morality which had found its strongest sanctions
in those ideas. Upon all this, Patrick Henry
looked with grief and alarm. In his opinion, a far
deeper, a far wiser and nobler handling of all the
immense questions involved in the problem of the
truth of Christianity was furnished by such English
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
writers as Sherlock and Bishop Butler, and, for
popular use, even Soame Jenyns. Therefore, as
French scepticism then had among the Virginia
lawyers and politicians its diligent missionaries, so,
with the energy and directness that always characterized
him, he determined to confront it, if possible,
with an equal diligence; and he then deliberately
made himself, while still a Virginia lawyer
and politician, a missionary also,&mdash;a missionary
on behalf of rational and enlightened Christian
faith. Thus during his second term as governor
he caused to be printed, on his own account, an
edition of Soame Jenyns&#8217;s &#8220;View of the Internal
Evidence of Christianity;&#8221; likewise, an edition of
Butler&#8217;s &#8220;Analogy;&#8221; and thenceforward, particularly
among the young men of Virginia, assailed as
they were by the fashionable scepticism, this illustrious
colporteur was active in the defence of
Christianity, not only by his own sublime and persuasive
arguments, but by the distribution, as the
fit occasion offered, of one or the other of these
two books.</p>

<p>Accordingly when, during the first two years of
his retirement, Thomas Paine&#8217;s &#8220;Age of Reason&#8221;
made its appearance, the old statesman was moved
to write out a somewhat elaborate treatise in defence
of the truth of Christianity. This treatise it
was his purpose to have published. &#8220;He read the
manuscript to his family as he progressed with it,
and completed it a short time before his death.&#8221;
When it was finished, however, being &#8220;diffident
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
about his own work,&#8221; and impressed, also, by the
great ability of the replies to Paine which were
then appearing in England, &#8220;he directed his wife
to destroy&#8221; what he had written. She &#8220;complied
literally with his directions,&#8221; and thus put beyond
the chance of publication a work which seemed, to
some who heard it, to be &#8220;the most eloquent and
unanswerable argument in the defence of the Bible
which was ever written.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor453" id="FNanchor453"></a><a href="#Footnote-453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p>Finally, in his last will and testament, bearing
the date of November 20, 1798, and written
throughout, as he says, &#8220;with my own hand,&#8221; he
chose to insert a touching affirmation of his own
deep faith in Christianity. After distributing his
estate among his descendants, he thus concludes:
&#8220;This is all the inheritance I can give to my dear
family. The religion of Christ can give them one
which will make them rich indeed.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor454" id="FNanchor454"></a><a href="#Footnote-454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p>It is not to be imagined that this deep seclusion
and these eager religious studies implied in Patrick
Henry any forgetfulness of the political concerns
of his own country, or any indifference to those
mighty events which, during those years, were
taking place in Europe, and were reacting with
tremendous effect upon the thought, the emotion,
and even the material interests of America. Neither
did he succeed in thus preserving the retirement
which he had resolved upon, without having
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
to resist the attempts of both political parties to
draw him forth again into official life. All these
matters, indeed, are involved in the story of his
political attitude from the close of his struggle for
amending the Constitution down to the very close
of his life,&mdash;a story which used to be told with
angry vituperation on one side, perhaps with some
meek apologies on the other. Certainly, the day
for such comment is long past. In the disinterestedness
which the lapse of time has now made
an easy virtue for us, we may see, plainly enough,
that such ungentle words as &#8220;apostate&#8221; and &#8220;turncoat,&#8221;
with which his name used to be plentifully
assaulted, were but the missiles of partisan excitement;
and that by his act of intellectual readjustment
with respect to the new conditions forced
upon human society, on both sides of the Atlantic,
by the French Revolution, he developed no occasion
for apologies, since he therein did nothing
that was unusual at that time among honest and
thoughtful men everywhere, and nothing that was
inconsistent with the professions or the tendencies
of his own previous life. It becomes our duty,
however, to trace this story over again, as concisely
as possible, but in the light of much historical
evidence that has never hitherto been presented
in connection with it.</p>

<p>Upon the adoption, in 1791, of the first ten
amendments to the Constitution, every essential
objection which he had formerly urged against that
instrument was satisfied; and there then remained
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
no good reason why he should any longer hold
himself aloof from the cordial support of the new
government, especially as directed, first by Washington,
and afterward by John Adams,&mdash;two men
with whom, both personally and politically, he had
always been in great harmony, excepting only
upon this single matter of the Constitution in its
original form. Undoubtedly, the contest which he
had waged on that question had been so hot and
so bitter that, even after it was ended, some time
would be required for his recovery from the soreness
of spirit, from the tone of suspicion and even
of enmity, which it had occasioned. Accordingly,
in the correspondence and other records of the
time, we catch some glimpses of him, which show
that even after Congress had passed the great
amendments, and after their approval by the
States had become a thing assured, he still looked
askance at the administration, and particularly at
some of the financial measures proposed by Hamilton.<a name="FNanchor455" id="FNanchor455"></a><a href="#Footnote-455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>
Nevertheless, as year by year went on, and
as Washington and his associates continued to
deal fairly, wisely, and, on the whole, successfully,
with the enormous problems which they encountered;
moreover, as Jefferson and Madison gradually
drew off from Washington, and formed a
party in opposition, which seemed to connive at
the proceedings of Genet, and to encourage the
formation among us of political clubs in apparent
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
sympathy with the wildest and most anarchic doctrines
which were then flung into words and into
deeds in the streets of Paris, it happened that
Patrick Henry found himself, like Richard Henry
Lee, and many another of his companions in the
old struggle against the Constitution, drawn more
and more into support of the new government.</p>

<p>In this frame of mind, probably, was he in the
spring of 1793, when, during the session of the
federal court at Richmond, he had frequent conversations
with Chief Justice Jay and with Judge
Iredell. The latter, having never before met
Henry, had felt great dislike of him on account
of the alleged violence of his opinions against the
Constitution; but after making his acquaintance,
Iredell thus wrote concerning him: &#8220;I never was
more agreeably disappointed than in my acquaintance
with him. I have been much in his company;
and his manners are very pleasing, and his
mind, I am persuaded, highly liberal. It is a
strong additional reason I have, added to many
others, to hold in high detestation violent party
prejudice.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor456" id="FNanchor456"></a><a href="#Footnote-456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p>

<p>In the following year, General Henry Lee, then
governor of Virginia, appointed Patrick Henry as
a senator of the United States, to fill out an unexpired
term. This honor he felt compelled to decline.</p>

<p>In the course of the same year, General Lee,
finding that Patrick Henry, though in virtual sympathy
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
with the administration, was yet under the
impression that Washington had cast off their old
friendship, determined to act the part of a peacemaker
between them, and, if possible, bring together
once more two old friends who had been
parted by political differences that no longer existed.
On the 17th of August, 1794, Lee, at
Richmond, thus wrote to the President:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;When I saw you in Philadelphia, I had many conversations
with you respecting Mr. Henry, and since my
return I have talked very freely and confidentially with
that gentleman. I plainly perceive that he has credited
some information, which he has received (from whom I
know not), which induces him to believe that you consider
him a factious, seditious character.&hellip; Assured
in my own mind that his opinions are groundless, I have
uniformly combated them, and lament that my endeavors
have been unavailing. He seems to be deeply and
sorely affected. It is very much to be regretted; for
he is a man of positive virtue as well as of transcendent
talents; and were it not for his feelings above expressed,
I verily believe, he would be found among the most
active supporters of your administration. Excuse me
for mentioning this matter to you. I have long wished
to do it, in the hope that it would lead to a refutation of
the sentiments entertained by Mr. Henry.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor457" id="FNanchor457"></a><a href="#Footnote-457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p></div>

<p>To this letter Washington sent a reply which
expressed unabated regard for his old friend; and
this reply, having been shown by Lee to Henry,
drew from him this noble-minded answer:&mdash;<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">TO GENERAL HENRY LEE.</p>

<p class="right1">
<span class="smcap">Red Hill</span>, 27 June, 1795.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your very friendly communication
of so much of the President&#8217;s letter as relates to me, demands
my sincere thanks. Retired as I am from the
busy world, it is still grateful to me to know that some
portion of regard remains for me amongst my countrymen;
especially those of them whose opinions I most
value. But the esteem of that personage, who is contemplated
in this correspondence, is highly flattering indeed.</p>

<p>The American Revolution was the grand operation,
which seemed to be assigned by the Deity to the men of
this age in our country, over and above the common
duties of life. I ever prized at a high rate the superior
privilege of being one in that chosen age, to which
Providence intrusted its favorite work. With this impression,
it was impossible for me to resist the impulse
I felt to contribute my mite towards accomplishing that
event, which in future will give a superior aspect to the
men of these times. To the man, especially, who led
our armies, will that aspect belong; and it is not in
nature for one with my feelings to revere the Revolution,
without including him who stood foremost in its establishment.</p>

<p>Every insinuation that taught me to believe I had
forfeited the good-will of that personage, to whom the
world had agreed to ascribe the appellation of good and
great, must needs give me pain; particularly as he had
opportunities of knowing my character both in public
and in private life. The intimation now given me, that
there was no ground to believe I had incurred his censure,
gives very great pleasure.<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span></p>

<p>Since the adoption of the present Constitution, I have
generally moved in a narrow circle. But in that I have
never omitted to inculcate a strict adherence to the principles
of it. And I have the satisfaction to think, that
in no part of the Union have the laws been more pointedly
obeyed, than in that where I have resided and spent
my time. Projects, indeed, of a contrary tendency have
been hinted to me; but the treatment of the projectors
has been such as to prevent all intercourse with them for
a long time. Although a democrat myself, I like not
the late democratic societies. As little do I like their
suppression by law. Silly things may amuse for awhile,
but in a little time men will perceive their delusions.
The way to preserve in men&#8217;s minds a value for them,
is to enact laws against them.</p>

<p>My present views are to spend my days in privacy.
If, however, it shall please God, during my life, so to
order the course of events as to render my feeble efforts
necessary for the safety of the country, in any, even the
smallest degree, that little which I can do shall be done.
Whenever you may have an opportunity, I shall be much
obliged by your presenting my best respects and duty
to the President, assuring him of my gratitude for his
favorable sentiments towards me.</p>

<p>Be assured, my dear sir, of the esteem and regard
with which I am yours, etc.,</p>

<p class="right1">
<span class="smcap">Patrick Henry.</span><a name="FNanchor458" id="FNanchor458"></a><a href="#Footnote-458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>
</p></div>

<p>After seeing this letter, Washington took an
opportunity to convey to Patrick Henry a strong
practical proof of his confidence in him, and of his
cordial friendship. The office of secretary of state
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
having become vacant, Washington thus tendered
the place to Patrick Henry:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right1"><span class="smcap">Mount Vernon,</span> 9 October, 1795.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Whatever may be the reception of this
letter, truth and candor shall mark its steps. You
doubtless know that the office of state is vacant; and no
one can be more sensible than yourself of the importance
of filling it with a person of abilities, and one in
whom the public would have confidence.</p>

<p>It would be uncandid not to inform you that this office
has been offered to others; but it is as true, that it
was from a conviction in my own mind that you would
not accept it (until Tuesday last, in a conversation with
General Lee, he dropped sentiments which made it less
doubtful), that it was not offered first to you.</p>

<p>I need scarcely add, that if this appointment could be
made to comport with your own inclination, it would
be as pleasing to me, as I believe it would be acceptable
to the public. With this assurance, and with this belief,
I make you the offer of it. My first wish is that you
would accept it; the next is that you would be so good
as to give me an answer as soon as you conveniently
can, as the public business in that department is now
suffering for want of a secretary.<a name="FNanchor459" id="FNanchor459"></a><a href="#Footnote-459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p></div>

<p>Though Patrick Henry declined this proposal,
he declined it for reasons that did not shut the
door against further overtures of a similar kind;
for, within the next three months, a vacancy having
occurred in another great office,&mdash;that of
chief justice of the United States,&mdash;Washington
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
again employed the friendly services of General
Lee, whom he authorized to offer the place to
Patrick Henry. This was done by Lee in a letter
dated December 26, 1795:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The Senate have disagreed to the President&#8217;s nomination
of Mr. Rutledge, and a vacancy in that important
office has taken place. For your country&#8217;s sake, for
your friends&#8217; sake, for your family&#8217;s sake, tell me you
will obey a call to it. You know my friendship for you;
you know my circumspection; and, I trust, you know,
too, I would not address you on such a subject without
good grounds. Surely no situation better suits you.
You continue at home, only [except] when on duty.
Change of air and exercise will add to your days. The
salary excellent, and the honor very great. Be explicit
in your reply.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor460" id="FNanchor460"></a><a href="#Footnote-460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p></div>

<p>On the same day on which Lee thus wrote to
Henry he likewise wrote to Washington, informing
him that he had done so; but, for some cause
now unknown, Washington received no further
word from Lee for more than two weeks. Accordingly,
on the 11th of January, 1796, in his anxiety
to know what might be Patrick Henry&#8217;s decision
concerning the office of chief justice, Washington
wrote to Lee as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your letter of the 26th ult. has
been received, but nothing from you since,&mdash;which is
embarrassing in the extreme; for not only the nomination
of chief justice, but an associate judge, and secretary
of war, is suspended on the answer you were to
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
receive from Mr. Henry; and what renders the want of
it more to be regretted is, that the first Monday of next
month (which happens on the first day of it) is the term
appointed by law for the meeting of the Superior Court
of the United States, in this city; at which, for particular
reasons, the bench ought to be full. I will add no
more at present than that I am your affectionate,</p>

<p class="right1">
<span class="smcap">Geo. Washington.</span><a name="FNanchor461" id="FNanchor461"></a><a href="#Footnote-461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>
</p></div>

<p>Although Patrick Henry declined this great
compliment also, his friendliness to the administration
had become so well understood that, among
the Federal leaders, who in the spring of 1796
were planning for the succession to Washington
and Adams, there was a strong inclination to nominate
Patrick Henry for the vice-presidency,&mdash;their
chief doubt being with reference to his willingness
to take the nomination.<a name="FNanchor462" id="FNanchor462"></a><a href="#Footnote-462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p>All these overtures to Patrick Henry were somewhat
jealously watched by Jefferson, who, indeed,
in a letter to Monroe, on the 10th of July, 1796,
interpreted them with that easy recklessness of
statement which so frequently embellished his private
correspondence and his private talk. &#8220;Most
assiduous court,&#8221; he says of the Federalists, &#8220;is
paid to Patrick Henry. He has been offered
everything which they knew he would not accept.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor463" id="FNanchor463"></a><a href="#Footnote-463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p>A few weeks after Jefferson penned those sneering
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
words, the person thus alluded to wrote to his
daughter, Mrs. Aylett, concerning certain troublesome
reports which had reached her:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;As to the reports you have heard, of my changing
sides in politics, I can only say they are not true. I
am too old to exchange my former opinions, which have
grown up into fixed habits of thinking. True it is, I
have condemned the conduct of our members in Congress,
because, in refusing to raise money for the purposes
of the British treaty, they, in effect, would have
surrendered our country bound, hand and foot, to the
power of the British nation.&hellip; The treaty is, in my
opinion, a very bad one indeed. But what must I think
of those men, whom I myself warned of the danger of
giving the power of making laws by means of treaty to
the President and Senate, when I see these same men
denying the existence of that power, which, they insisted
in our convention, ought properly to be exercised by the
President and Senate, and by none other? The policy
of these men, both then and now, appears to me quite
void of wisdom and foresight. These sentiments I did
mention in conversation in Richmond, and perhaps
others which I don&#8217;t remember.&hellip; It seems that
every word was watched which I casually dropped, and
wrested to answer party views. Who can have been so
meanly employed, I know not, neither do I care; for I
no longer consider myself as an actor on the stage of
public life. It is time for me to retire; and I shall
never more appear in a public character, unless some
unlooked-for circumstance shall demand from me a
transient effort, not inconsistent with private life&mdash;in
which I have determined to continue.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor464" id="FNanchor464"></a><a href="#Footnote-464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
In the autumn of 1796 the Assembly of Virginia,
then under the political control of Jefferson,
and apparently eager to compete with the Federalists
for the possession of a great name, elected
Patrick Henry to the governorship of the State.
But the man whose purpose to refuse office had
been proof against the attractions of the United
States Senate, and of the highest place in Washington&#8217;s
cabinet, and of the highest judicial position
in the country, was not likely to succumb to
the opportunity of being governor of Virginia for
the sixth time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII <br />
<span class="hsub">LAST DAYS</span></h2>


<p>The intimation given by Patrick Henry to his
daughter, in the summer of 1796, that, though he
could never again engage in a public career, he
yet might be compelled by &#8220;some unlooked-for
circumstance&#8221; to make &#8220;a transient effort&#8221; for
the public safety, was not put to the test until
nearly three years afterward, when it was verified
in the midst of those days in which he was
suddenly to find surcease of all earthly care and
pain.</p>

<p>Our story, therefore, now passes hurriedly by
the year 1797,&mdash;which saw the entrance of John
Adams into the presidency, the return of Monroe
from France in great anger at the men who had
recalled him, the publication of Jefferson&#8217;s letter
to Mazzei, everywhere an increasing bitterness and
even violence in partisan feeling. In the same
manner, also, must we pass by the year 1798,&mdash;which
saw the popular uprising against France,
the mounting of the black cockade against her, the
suspension of commercial intercourse with her, the
summons to Washington to come forth once more
and lead the armies of America against the enemy;<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
then the moonstruck madness of the Federalists,
forcing upon the country the naturalization act,
the alien acts, the sedition act; then the Kentucky
resolutions, as written by Jefferson, declaring
the acts just named to be &#8220;not law, but utterly
void and of no force,&#8221; and liable, &#8220;unless arrested
on the threshold,&#8221; &#8220;to drive these States
into revolution and blood;&#8221; then the Virginia
resolutions, as written by Madison, denouncing the
same acts as &#8220;palpable and alarming infractions
of the Constitution;&#8221; finally, the preparations
secretly making by the government of Virginia<a name="FNanchor465" id="FNanchor465"></a><a href="#Footnote-465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>
for armed resistance to the government of the
United States.</p>

<p>Just seven days after the passage of the Virginia
resolutions, an eminent citizen of that State
appealed by letter to Patrick Henry for some written
expression of his views upon the troubled situation,
with the immediate object of aiding in the
election of John Marshall, who, having just before
returned from his baffled embassy to Paris, was
then in nomination for Congress, and was encountering
assaults directed by every energy and art of
the opposition. In response to this appeal, Patrick
Henry wrote, in the early part of the year 1799,
the following remarkable letter, which is of deep
interest still, not only as showing his discernment
of the true nature of that crisis, but as furnishing
a complete answer to the taunt that his mental
faculties were then fallen into decay:&mdash;<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">TO ARCHIBALD BLAIR.</p>

<p class="right1">
<span class="smcap">Red Hill, Charlotte</span>, 8 January, 1799.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your favor of the 28th of last month I
have received. Its contents are a fresh proof that there
is cause for much lamentation over the present state of
things in Virginia. It is possible that most of the individuals
who compose the contending factions are sincere,
and act from honest motives. But it is more than
probable, that certain leaders meditate a change in government.
To effect this, I see no way so practicable
as dissolving the confederacy. And I am free to own,
that, in my judgment, most of the measures lately pursued
by the opposition party, directly and certainly lead
to that end. If this is not the system of the party, they
have none, and act &#8216;ex tempore.&#8217;</p>

<p>I do acknowledge that I am not capable to form a
correct judgment on the present politics of the world.
The wide extent to which the present contentions have
gone will scarcely permit any observer to see enough in
detail to enable him to form anything like a tolerable
judgment on the final result, as it may respect the nations
in general. But, as to France, I have no doubt
in saying that to her it will be calamitous. Her conduct
has made it the interest of the great family of
mankind to wish the downfall of her present government;
because its existence is incompatible with that of
all others within its reach. And, whilst I see the dangers
that threaten ours from her intrigues and her arms,
I am not so much alarmed as at the apprehension of her
destroying the great pillars of all government and of
social life,&mdash;I mean virtue, morality, and religion.
This is the armor, my friend, and this alone, that renders
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
us invincible. These are the tactics we should
study. If we lose these, we are conquered, fallen indeed.
In vain may France show and vaunt her diplomatic
skill, and brave troops: so long as our manners
and principles remain sound, there is no danger. But
believing, as I do, that these are in danger, that infidelity
in its broadest sense, under the name of philosophy,
is fast spreading, and that, under the patronage of
French manners and principles, everything that ought
to be dear to man is covertly but successfully assailed,
I feel the value of those men amongst us, who hold out
to the world the idea, that our continent is to exhibit an
originality of character; and that, instead of that imitation
and inferiority which the countries of the old
world have been in the habit of exacting from the new,
we shall maintain that high ground upon which nature
has placed us, and that Europe will alike cease to rule
us and give us modes of thinking.</p>

<p>But I must stop short, or else this letter will be all
preface. These prefatory remarks, however, I thought
proper to make, as they point out the kind of character
amongst our countrymen most estimable in my
eyes. General Marshall and his colleagues exhibited
the American character as respectable. France, in the
period of her most triumphant fortune, beheld them as
unappalled. Her threats left them, as she found them,
mild, temperate, firm. Can it be thought that, with
these sentiments, I should utter anything tending to prejudice
General Marshall&#8217;s election? Very far from it
indeed. Independently of the high gratification I felt
from his public ministry, he ever stood high in my esteem
as a private citizen. His temper and disposition
were always pleasant, his talents and integrity unquestioned.<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
These things are sufficient to place that gentleman
far above any competitor in the district for Congress.
But, when you add the particular information
and insight which he has gained, and is able to communicate
to our public councils, it is really astonishing that
even blindness itself should hesitate in the choice.&hellip;
Tell Marshall I love him, because he felt and acted as
a republican, as an American.&hellip; I am too old and
infirm ever again to undertake public concerns. I live
much retired, amidst a multiplicity of blessings from
that Gracious Ruler of all things, to whom I owe unceasing
acknowledgments for his unmerited goodness to
me; and if I was permitted to add to the catalogue one
other blessing, it should be, that my countrymen should
learn wisdom and virtue, and in this their day to know
the things that pertain to their peace. Farewell.</p>

<p>The appeal from Archibald Blair, which evoked
this impressive letter, had suggested to the old
statesman no effort which could not be made in
his retirement. Before, however, he was to pass
beyond the reach of all human appeals, two others
were to be addressed to him, the one by John
Adams, the other by Washington, both asking him
to come forth into the world again; the former
calling for his help in averting war with France,
the latter for his help in averting the triumph of
violent and dangerous counsels at home.</p>

<p>On the 25th of February, 1799, John Adams,
shaking himself free of his partisan counsellors,&mdash;all
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
hot for war with France,&mdash;suddenly changed
the course of history by sending to the Senate the
names of these three citizens, Oliver Ellsworth,
Patrick Henry, and William Vans Murray, &#8220;to be
envoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary
to the French republic, with full powers to discuss
and settle, by a treaty, all controversies between
the United States and France.&#8221; In his letter of
the 16th of April declining the appointment, Patrick
Henry spoke of himself as having been &#8220;confined
for several weeks by a severe indisposition,&#8221;
and as being &#8220;still so sick as to be scarcely able to
write this.&#8221; &#8220;My advanced age,&#8221; he added, &#8220;and
increasing debility compel me to abandon every
idea of serving my country, where the scene of
operation is far distant, and her interests call for
incessant and long continued exertion.&hellip; I cannot,
however, forbear expressing, on this occasion,
the high sense I entertain of the honor done me
by the President and Senate in the appointment.
And I beg you, sir, to present me to them in
terms of the most dutiful regard, assuring them
that this mark of their confidence in me, at a crisis
so eventful, is an agreeable and flattering proof of
their consideration towards me, and that nothing
short of an absolute necessity could induce me to
withhold my little aid from an administration whose
ability, patriotism, and virtue deserve the gratitude
and reverence of all their fellow citizens.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor467" id="FNanchor467"></a><a href="#Footnote-467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></p>

<p>Such was John Adams&#8217;s appeal to Patrick
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
Henry and its result. The appeal to him from
Washington&mdash;an appeal which he could not resist,
and which induced him, even in his extreme feebleness
of body, to make one last and noble exertion
of his genius&mdash;happened in this wise. On the
15th of January, 1799, from Mount Vernon, Washington
wrote to his friend a long letter, marked
&#8220;confidential,&#8221; in which he stated with great frankness
his own anxieties respecting the dangers then
threatening the country:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;It would be a waste of time to attempt to bring to
the view of a person of your observation and discernment,
the endeavors of a certain party among us to
disquiet the public mind with unfounded alarms; to arraign
every act of the administration; to set the people
at variance with their government; and to embarrass all
its measures. Equally useless would it be to predict
what must be the inevitable consequences of such a
policy, if it cannot be arrested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfortunately,&mdash;and extremely do I regret it,&mdash;the
State of Virginia has taken the lead in this opposition.&hellip;
It has been said that the great mass of the
citizens of this State are well-affected, notwithstanding,
to the general government and the Union; and I am
willing to believe it, nay, do believe it. But how is this
to be reconciled with their suffrages at the elections
of representatives, &hellip; who are men opposed to the
former, and by the tendency of their measures would
destroy the latter?&hellip; One of the reasons assigned is,
that the most respectable and best qualified characters
among us will not come forward.&hellip; But, at such a
crisis as this, when everything dear and valuable to us
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
is assailed; when this party hangs upon the wheels of
government as a dead weight, opposing every measure
that is calculated for defence and self-preservation, abetting
the nefarious views of another nation upon our
rights; &hellip; when measures are systematically and pertinaciously
pursued, which must eventually dissolve the
Union, or produce coercion; I say, when these things
have become so obvious, ought characters who are best
able to rescue their country from the pending evil, to
remain at home? Rather ought they not to come forward,
and by their talents and influence stand in the
breach which such conduct has made on the peace and
happiness of this country, and oppose the widening of
it?&hellip;</p>

<p>&#8220;I come, now, my good Sir, to the object of my
letter, which is to express a hope and an earnest wish,
that you will come forward at the ensuing elections
(if not for Congress, which you may think would take
you too long from home), as a candidate for representative
in the General Assembly of this Commonwealth.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are, I have no doubt, very many sensible
men who oppose themselves to the torrent that carries
away others who had rather swim with, than stem it
without an able pilot to conduct them; but these are
neither old in legislation, nor well known in the community.
Your weight of character and influence in the
House of Representatives would be a bulwark against
such dangerous sentiments as are delivered there at present.
It would be a rallying point for the timid, and
an attraction of the wavering. In a word, I conceive it
to be of immense importance at this crisis, that you
should be there; and I would fain hope that all minor
considerations will be made to yield to the measure.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor468" id="FNanchor468"></a><a href="#Footnote-468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
There can be little doubt that it was this solemn
invocation on the part of Washington which induced
the old statesman, on whom Death had already
begun to lay his icy hands, to come forth
from the solitude in which he had been so long
buried, and offer himself for the suffrages of his
neighbors, as their representative in the next House
of Delegates, there to give check, if possible, to
the men who seemed to be hurrying Virginia upon
violent courses, and the republic into civil war.
Accordingly, before the day for the usual March<a name="FNanchor469" id="FNanchor469"></a><a href="#Footnote-469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>
court in Charlotte, the word went out through all
that country that old Patrick Henry, whose wondrous
voice in public no man had heard for those
many years, who had indeed been almost numbered
among the dead ones of their heroic days foregone,
was to appear before all the people once more, and
speak to them as in the former time, and give to
them his counsel amid those thickening dangers
which alone could have drawn him forth from the
very borders of the grave.</p>

<p>When the morning of that day came, from all
the region thereabout the people began to stream
toward the place where the orator was to speak.
So widespread was the desire to hear him that
even the college in the next county&mdash;the college
of Hampden-Sidney&mdash;suspended its work for that
day, and thus enabled all its members, the president
himself, the professors, and the students, to
hurry over to Charlotte court-house. One of those
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
students, John Miller, of South Carolina, according
to an account said to have been given by him
in conversation forty years afterward, having with
his companions reached the town,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;and having learned that the great orator would speak
in the porch of a tavern fronting the large court-green,
&hellip; pushed his way through the gathering crowd, and
secured the pedestal of a pillar, where he stood within
eight feet of him. He was very infirm, and seated in
a chair conversing with some old friends, waiting for the
assembling of the immense multitudes who were pouring
in from all the surrounding country to hear him. At
length he arose with difficulty, and stood somewhat
bowed with age and weakness. His face was almost
colorless. His countenance was careworn; and when
he commenced his exordium, his voice was slightly
cracked and tremulous. But in a few moments a wonderful
transformation of the whole man occurred, as
he warmed with his theme. He stood erect; his eye
beamed with a light that was almost supernatural; his
features glowed with the hue and fire of youth; and
his voice rang clear and melodious with the intonations
of some grand musical instrument whose notes filled the
area, and fell distinctly and delightfully upon the ears
of the most distant of the thousands gathered before
him.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor470" id="FNanchor470"></a><a href="#Footnote-470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p></div>

<p>As regards the substance of the speech then
made, it will not be safe for us to confide very
much in the supposed recollections of old men who
heard it when they were young. Upon the whole,<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
probably, the most trustworthy outline of it now
to be had is that of a gentleman who declares that
he wrote down his recollections of the speech not
long after its delivery. According to this account,
Patrick Henry&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;told them that the late proceedings of the Virginian
Assembly had filled him with apprehensions and
alarm; that they had planted thorns upon his pillow;
that they had drawn him from that happy retirement
which it had pleased a bountiful Providence to bestow,
and in which he had hoped to pass, in quiet, the remainder
of his days; that the State had quitted the sphere
in which she had been placed by the Constitution, and,
in daring to pronounce upon the validity of federal
laws, had gone out of her jurisdiction in a manner not
warranted by any authority, and in the highest degree
alarming to every considerate man; that such opposition,
on the part of Virginia, to the acts of the general
government, must beget their enforcement by military
power; that this would probably produce civil war,
civil war foreign alliances, and that foreign alliances
must necessarily end in subjugation to the powers called
in. He conjured the people to pause and consider well,
before they rushed into such a desperate condition, from
which there could be no retreat. He painted to their
imaginations Washington, at the head of a numerous
and well-appointed army, inflicting upon them military
execution. &#8216;And where,&#8217; he asked, &#8216;are our resources
to meet such a conflict? Where is the citizen
of America who will dare to lift his hand against the
father of his country?&#8217; A drunken man in the crowd
threw up his arm, and exclaimed that he dared to do
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
it. &#8216;No,&#8217; answered Mr. Henry, rising aloft in all his
majesty, &#8216;you dare not do it: in such a parricidal attempt,
the steel would drop from your nerveless arm!&#8217; &hellip;
Mr. Henry, proceeding in his address to the people,
asked whether the county of Charlotte would have
any authority to dispute an obedience to the laws of
Virginia; and he pronounced Virginia to be to the
Union what the county of Charlotte was to her. Having
denied the right of a State to decide upon the constitutionality
of federal laws, he added, that perhaps it
might be necessary to say something of the merits of
the laws in question.<a name="FNanchor471" id="FNanchor471"></a><a href="#Footnote-471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> His private opinion was that
they were good and proper. But whatever might be
their merits, it belonged to the people, who held the
reins over the head of Congress, and to them alone, to
say whether they were acceptable or otherwise to Virginians;
and that this must be done by way of petition;
that Congress were as much our representatives as the
Assembly, and had as good a right to our confidence.
He had seen with regret the unlimited power over the
purse and sword consigned to the general government;
but &hellip; he had been overruled, and it was now necessary
to submit to the constitutional exercise of that
power. &#8216;If,&#8217; said he, &#8216;I am asked what is to be done,
when a people feel themselves intolerably oppressed, my
answer is ready,&mdash;Overturn the government. But do
not, I beseech you, carry matters to this length without
provocation. Wait at least until some infringement is
made upon your rights, and which cannot otherwise be
redressed; for if ever you recur to another change, you
may bid adieu forever to representative government.
You can never exchange the present government but
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
for a monarchy.&hellip; Let us preserve our strength for
the French, the English, the Germans, or whoever else
shall dare to invade our territory, and not exhaust it in
civil commotions and intestine wars.&#8217; He concluded by
declaring his design to exert himself in the endeavor to
allay the heart-burnings and jealousies which had been
fomented in the state legislature; and he fervently
prayed, if he was deemed unworthy to effect it, that it
might be reserved to some other and abler hand to extend
this blessing over the community.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor472" id="FNanchor472"></a><a href="#Footnote-472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></p></div>

<p>The outline thus given may be inaccurate in
several particulars: it is known to be so in one.
Respecting the alien and sedition acts, the orator
expressed no opinion at all;<a name="FNanchor473" id="FNanchor473"></a><a href="#Footnote-473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> but accepting them
as the law of the land, he counselled moderation,
forbearance, and the use of constitutional means
of redress. Than that whole effort, as has been
said by a recent and a sagacious historian, &#8220;nothing
in his life was nobler.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor474" id="FNanchor474"></a><a href="#Footnote-474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

<p>Upon the conclusion of the old man&#8217;s speech the
stand was taken by a very young man, John Randolph
of Roanoke, who undertook to address the
crowd, offering himself to them as a candidate for
Congress, but on behalf of the party then opposed
to Patrick Henry. By reason of weariness, no
doubt, the latter did not remain upon the platform;
but having &#8220;requested a friend to report to him
anything which might require an answer,&#8221; he
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
stepped back into the tavern. &#8220;Randolph began
by saying that he had admired that man more than
any on whom the sun had shone, but that now he
was constrained to differ from him &#8216;<i>toto c&#339;lo</i>.&#8217;&#8221;
Whatever else Randolph may have said in his
speech, whether important or otherwise, was
spoken under the disadvantage of a cold and a
hoarseness so severe as to render him scarcely able
to &#8220;utter an audible sentence.&#8221; Furthermore,
Patrick Henry &#8220;made no reply, nor did he again
present himself to the people.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor475" id="FNanchor475"></a><a href="#Footnote-475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> There is, however,
a tradition, not improbable, that when Randolph
had finished his speech, and had come back
into the room where the aged statesman was resting,
the latter, taking him gently by the hand,
said to him, with great kindness: &#8220;Young man,
you call me father. Then, my son, I have something
to say unto thee: keep justice, keep truth,&mdash;and
you will live to think differently.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a result of the poll, Patrick Henry was, by a
great majority, elected to the House of Delegates.
But his political enemies, who, for sufficient reasons,
greatly dreaded his appearance upon that
scene of his ancient domination, were never any
more to be embarrassed by his presence there.<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
For, truly, they who, on that March day, at Charlotte
court-house, had heard Patrick Henry, &#8220;had
heard an immortal orator who would never speak
again.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor476" id="FNanchor476"></a><a href="#Footnote-476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> He seems to have gone thence to his
home, and never to have left it. About the middle
of the next month, being too sick to write many
words, he lifted himself up in bed long enough to
tell the secretary of state that he could not go on
the mission to France, and to send his dying blessing
to his old friend, the President. Early in
June, his eldest daughter, Martha Fontaine, living
at a distance of two days&#8217; travel from Red Hill,
received from him a letter beginning with these
words: &#8220;Dear Patsy, I am very unwell, and have
Dr. Cabell with me.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor477" id="FNanchor477"></a><a href="#Footnote-477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> Upon this alarming news,
she and others of his kindred in that neighborhood
made all haste to go to him. On arriving at Red
Hill &#8220;they found him sitting in a large, old-fashioned
armchair, in which he was easier than upon a
bed.&#8221; The disease of which he was dying was intussusception.
On the 6th of June, all other remedies
having failed, Dr. Cabell proceeded to administer to
him a dose of liquid mercury. Taking the vial in
his hand, and looking at it for a moment, the dying
man said: &#8220;I suppose, doctor, this is your last resort?&#8221;
The doctor replied: &#8220;I am sorry to say,
governor, that it is. Acute inflammation of the
intestine has already taken place; and unless it is
removed, mortification will ensue, if it has not already
commenced, which I fear.&#8221; &#8220;What will be
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
the effect of this medicine?&#8221; said the old man.
&#8220;It will give you immediate relief, or&#8221;&mdash;the kind-hearted
doctor could not finish the sentence. His
patient took up the word: &#8220;You mean, doctor,
that it will give relief, or will prove fatal immediately?&#8221;
The doctor answered: &#8220;You can only
live a very short time without it, and it may possibly
relieve you.&#8221; Then Patrick Henry said, &#8220;Excuse
me, doctor, for a few minutes;&#8221; and drawing
down over his eyes a silken cap which he usually
wore, and still holding the vial in his hand, he
prayed, in clear words, a simple childlike prayer,
for his family, for his country, and for his own
soul then in the presence of death. Afterward,
in perfect calmness, he swallowed the medicine.
Meanwhile, Dr. Cabell, who greatly loved him,
went out upon the lawn, and in his grief threw
himself down upon the earth under one of the
trees, weeping bitterly. Soon, when he had sufficiently
mastered himself, the doctor came back to
his patient, whom he found calmly watching the
congealing of the blood under his finger-nails, and
speaking words of love and peace to his family,
who were weeping around his chair. Among other
things, he told them that he was thankful for
that goodness of God, which, having blessed him
through all his life, was then permitting him to
die without any pain. Finally, fixing his eyes with
much tenderness on his dear friend, Dr. Cabell,
with whom he had formerly held many arguments
respecting the Christian religion, he asked the doctor
<span class="pgnm"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
to observe how great a reality and benefit that
religion was to a man about to die. And after
Patrick Henry had spoken to his beloved physician
these few words in praise of something which, having
never failed him in all his life before, did not
then fail him in his very last need of it, he continued
to breathe very softly for some moments;
after which they who were looking upon him saw
that his life had departed.</p>
